title: "Understanding the Web"
---

These days there are many web browsers available to download for free, some of the popular ones are Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. Everyone knows how to use a browser from logging in to a social media to searching through google. As I learn more about web development, I start to understand how the web works.

The internet is just a network of computers that are sending data back and forth to each other. The different between the internet today and when it was created is the advancement of technology, we are able to connect machines all over the world. As a result we need regulations, that is where protocol comes in. One important protocol is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), all internet-connected devices speak it. To connect to the internet, the device has to listen on port 80 using Hypertext Transfer Protocol also known as HTTP. This allows the machine to request files over the network.

When you type in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) it might look something like this: `http://google.com/maps`. The first part tell us that it is a HTTP protocol, if it was https that means it is a encrypted HTTP request. The next part will be the domain name which is google.com, it will go to the domain name system (DNS). The DNS will look if the domain name is available, if that is true it will find the host server where the files for the web page is located. Last part is the path where it identifies the specific file we are interested in.

Sometime the URL you typed does not exist. There are HTTP status codes that tells the browser if the HTTP request was successful or something went wrong during the process. The HTTP status code 200 means that everything was successful and the files for the web page was found. A common HTTP status code is 404 which means the file was not found and is a client side error. The other status code is number above five hundred, this means it was a server side error.

The files that creates the web page is Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), and JavaScript. The HTML is the structure of the web page, this represents all the elements on the web page. The CSS is the style of the web page, this applies styles to the HTML elements. Lastly, JavaScript is the behavior, this allows users to interact with the HTML elements. Combining them together will give you a web page you see in your browser.

There are many ways to build a website. Majority of the websites today are built using a Content Management System (CMS) like WordPress or Squarespace. These systems allow users to build web application without any coding experience and are great for blogs, news, and shopping. You can also build web application using Java, Ruby, C#, Python, and other programming languages. There many ways of building a web application and is why technologies used at a company varies from one another. Many start up companies would use Ruby on Rails, while bigger companies might use ASP.NET.

The web is constantly evolving every year while new innovation in web development continues. The focus of web development is user experience (UX) and better data fetching from database. The files for the web pages continues to expand and become more complex that many new technologies are being used to organize these files. The web will continue to grow as developers add new features in the web applications.
