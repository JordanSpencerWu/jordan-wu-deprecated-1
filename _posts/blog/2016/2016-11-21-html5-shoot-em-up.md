title: "HTML 5 Shoot Em Up in an Afternoon"
---

There's a book called <a href="https://leanpub.com/html5shootemupinanafternoon/read" target="_blank">__HTML 5 Shoot 'em Up in an Afternoon__</a> by Bryan Bibat. This free to read book is for people who want to learn the basic concepts behind creating games on the web. It goes over how to create a simple shooter game with HTML5 using Phaser a browser game framework for desktop and mobile. I went through the tutorial and hosted the game on my github pages, click <a href="https://jordanspencerwu.github.io/shmup/" target="_blank">here</a> if you want to play it.
