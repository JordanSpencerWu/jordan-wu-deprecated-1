title: "JavaScript 30 Days Challenge"
---

The other day my brother told me to do this JavaScript 30 days coding challenge with him. The challenge is to create 30 things in 30 days using vanilla JavaScript by Wes Bos. This challenge can be done at your own pace and the main point is to continue creating things in JavaScript. I enjoy watching the tutorials and learned a lot from this challenge. I recommend anyone who is interested in learning more about JavaScript to do this challenge. In this blog I will briefly talk about what I learned from this challenge.

I have been learning about web development for over a year now. There's a lot to learn in the software industry and this challenge has helped me learn more about vanilla JavaScript. I'm the type of person who turns to jQuery or other frameworks like React to do DOM manipulation. During this challenge I learned how to write vanilla JavaScript to do these DOM manipulation along with using ES6 features to increase readability. This challenge made me reflect about how much do I really know about web development. There's a lot to learn and it's not about knowing everything, but the strive to learn more.

One important take away I learned from this challenge is to learn more about CSS. I have been relying on front-end frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, Foundation, or other frameworks to do most of the responsive web design styling. To help me learn more about CSS I decided to buy a book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CSS-Secrets-Solutions-Everyday-Problems/dp/1449372635/ref=zg_bs_379357011_4?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=HY5ZTCH69V9B5QZ142FE" target="_blank">CSS SECRETS BETTER SOLUTIONS TO EVERYDAY WEB DESIGN PROBLEM</a> by Lea Verou. I'm excited to start reading this book and to learn more about CSS in web design.

Wes Bos did an amazing job at making this challenge. Every tutorial there is something I learned, from adding event listeners to making cool web interactions. Anyone can do this challenge and the first step is by signing up for this challenge at <a href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript30</a>. All you need is 10 to 20 minutes each day to to this challenge.

I finished this challenge the other day and hosted some of the challenges on my github pages.
