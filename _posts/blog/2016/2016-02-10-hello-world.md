title: "Hello World!"
---

It is common that everyone writes a program called Hello World when learning a new programming language. For my first blog post, I will write "Hello World!" in every programming language I played with.

#### Ruby

{% highlight ruby %}
  puts "Hello World!"
{% endhighlight %}

#### JavaScript

{% highlight javascript %}
  console.log("Hello World!");
{% endhighlight %}

#### C++

{% highlight cpp %}
  cout << "Hello World!";
{% endhighlight %}

#### Java

{% highlight java %}
  System.out.print("Hello World!");
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>C#</h4>

{% highlight csharp %}
  System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
{% endhighlight %}

#### Python

{% highlight python %}
  print "Hello World"
{% endhighlight %}

#### Matlab

{% highlight matlab %}
  Disp("Hello World!")
{% endhighlight %}

I remember learning my first programming language at a community college a few years back. My first programming language was C++ and my first program was Hello World. You can learn how to code, all you need is the right tools to compile the code. Every programming language needs a compiler, a compiler is a program that converts your code into a low-level language like assembly language. A low-level language are instructions that tells the registers in your CPU to read from memory or write to memory. Our computers only understands binary so it uses a assembler program that converts the assembly language into machine code. Different operating systems understand different machine code and uses different assembler, it is important to download the correct tools depending on your operating system and the bits on your registers for example 32 bits or 64 bits. Remember when learning a new programming language, the first step is to download the tools needed to run the program. Programming is fun and anyone can start learning. The best way to start is by creating a Hello World program and the best part is getting to pick which languages to learn!
