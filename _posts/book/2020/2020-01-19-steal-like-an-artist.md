##### STEAL LIKE AN ARTIST.

Figure out what's worth stealing.

When you look at the world this way, you stop worrying about what's "good" and what's "bad" - there's only stuff worth stealing, and stuff that's not worth stealing.

"The only art I'll ever study is stuff that I can steal from."

Nothing is original.

All creative work builds on what came before.

##### DON'T WAIT UNTIL YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE TO GET STARTED.

it's the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are.

Your ready start making stuff.

They just show up to do their thing. Every day.

Fake it til you make it.

you have to start doing the work you want to be doing.

We learn by copying.

Copying is about reverse-engineering.

First, you have to figure out who to copy. Second, you have to figure out what to copy.

Transforming their work into something of your own is how you flatter them. Adding something to the world that only you can add.

##### WRITE THE BOOK YOU WANT TO READ

write what you like

Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use - do the work you want to see done.

##### USE YOUR HANDS

We need to move, to feel like we-re making something with our bodies, not just our heads.

You need to find a way to bring your body into your work.

##### SIDE PROJECTS AND HOBBIES ART IMPORTANT

Practice productive procrastination.

Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing.

Take time to mess around.

##### DO GOOD WORK AND SHARE IT WITH PEOPLE

you want attention only after you're doing really good work.

When you're unknown, there's nothing to distract you from getting better.

Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it.

Do good work and share it with people.

##### GEOGRAPHY IS NO LONGER OUR MASTER

You don't have to live anywhere other than the place you are to start connecting with the world you want to be in.

All you need is a little space and a little time - a place to work, and some time to do it.

Where we choose to live still has a huge impact on the work we do.

##### BE NICE

"There's only one rule I know of: You've got to be kind."

"The best way to get approval is to not need it."

You can't go looking for validation from external sources.

##### BE BORING

It takes a lot of energy to be creative.

Learn about money as soon as you can.

Freedom from financial stress also means freedom in your art.

Establishing and keeping a routine can be even more important than having a lot of time.

Inertia is the death of creativity.

Do the work every day, no matter what.

Work gets done in the time available.

Amassing a body of work or building a career is a lot about the slow accumulation of little bits of effort over time.

"marry well". Who you marry is the most important decision you'll ever make.

##### CREATIVITY IS SUBTRACTION

In this age of information abundance and overload, those who get ahead will be the folks who figure out what to leave out, so they can concentrate on what's really important to them.

The way to get over creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself.

"What we respond to in any work of art is the artist's struggle against his or her limitations.

You must embrace your limitations and keep moving.

Creativity isn't just the things we choose to put in, it's the things we choose to leave out.
