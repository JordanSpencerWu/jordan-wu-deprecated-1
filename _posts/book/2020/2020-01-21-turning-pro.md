When craft, dedication, and professionalism come together, the result can be astonishing.

What ails us is that we are living our lives as amateurs.

Turning pro is free.

What we get when we turn pro is, we find our power. We find our will and our voice and we find our self-respect. We become who we always were but had, until then, been afraid to embrace and to live out.

To feel ambition and to act upon it is to embrace the unique calling of our souls.

Sometimes, when we're terrified of embracing our true calling, we'll pursue a shadow calling instead.

That shadow career is a metaphor for our real career.

The amateur life is our youth. It's our hero's journey.

Becoming a pro, in the end, is nothing grander than growing up.

The shadow life is the life of the amateur.

The difference between an amateur and a professional is in their habits.

The human being is a creature of habit.

When we're living as amateurs, we're running away from our calling - meaning our work, our destiny, the obligation to become our truest and highest selves.

The addiction becomes the shadow version, the evil twin of our calling to service or to art.

Addictions and shadow careers are messages in a bottle from our unconscious.

Resistance hates two qualities above all others: concentration and depth.

The entity we're seeking union with is ourselves.

What you and I are really seeking is our own voice, our own truth, our own authenticity.

The habits and addictions of the amateur are conscious or unconscious self-inflicted wounds.

The amateur fears that if he turns pro and lives out his calling, he will have to live up to who he really is and what he is truly capable of.

The amateur fears, above all else, becoming (and being seen and judged as) himself.

In his heart, the amateur knows he's hiding.

The sure sign of an amateur is he has a million plans they all start tomorrow.

The force that can save the amateur is awareness, particularly self-awareness.

Fear of self-definition is what keeps an amateur an amateur and what keeps an addict and addict.

When we turn pro, we stop running from our fears. We turn around and face them.

Turning pro changes how we spend our time and with whom we spend it.

Turning pro is a decision.

Professional habits and qualities:

1. The professional shows up every day
2. The professional stays on the job all day
3. The professional is committed over the long haul
4. For the professional, the stakes are high and real
5. For the professional is patient
6. The professional seeks order
7. The professional demystifies

10. The professional plays it as it lays

13. The professional dedicates himself to mastering technique

15. The professional does not take failure or success personally
16. The professional does not identify with his or her instrument.
17. The professional endures adversity
18. The professional self-validates
19. The professional reinvents herself

The professional displays courage.

The pro works.

The professional is happy to teach.

The professional refuses to be iconized.

The pro will share his wisdom with other professionals - or with amateurs who are committed to becoming professionals.

When we do the work for itself alone, it turns into a practice.

We know what we have to do.

When we raise our game aesthetically, we elevate if morally and spiritually as well.

In the end, the enterprise and the sacrifice are all about the audience.
