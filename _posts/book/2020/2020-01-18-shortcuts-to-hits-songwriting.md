A song is all about - an emotional reaction to the melody, lyrics, and chords.

It's your message, your story, your emotions that are driving the song.

Be the master of your craft.

Craft is what helps you reach your audience but, for a song to be fulfilling for you as an artist, for you to love what you do, want to keep doing it, and grow while you do it, inspiration is essential.

The verse lyrics give the listener information. The lyrics change in each verse adding to the listener's understanding of the situation and emotional theme. The chord progression and melody remain the same in each verse with small variations in the melody to accommodate lyric change.

The chorus is the high point of a contemporary song. The chorus melody is catchy and memorable; the lyrics sum up and focus the overall theme laid out in the verse. The melody and lyric remain the same each time the chorus is repeated.

The hook is the most memorable line in your song. It often includes the title. It grabs attention and haul the listener into the song. It's the line that listener will remember long after the song is done.

The bridge occurs about two-thirds of the way into the song, after we've heard the verse or verse and chorus a couple of times. The bridge provides variety and relief from the now familiar verse and chorus melodies.

The pre-chorus occurs at the end of a verse and provides a build up to the chorus. It adds to the intensity of the song, creating a sense of anticipation that gives us a greater sense of emotional release when we get to the chorus.

Each change in volume level will attract attention.

Verse / Verse / Bridge / Verse

Verse / Chorus / Verse / Chorus / Bridge / Chorus

Verse / Pre-Chorus / Chorus / Verse / Pre-Chorus / Chorus / Bridge / Chorus

Repetition averts chaos and creates a recognizable pattern for listeners.

"Do it, do it again, go away, and then come back."

A verse can be from eight bars to sixteen bars. Pre-chorus range from four to eight bars. Chorus can be anywhere from eight bars up to fourteen or sixteen bars long.

When one song section ends and another begins, it creates a transition point.

The vast majority of hit songs are about love relationship.

Most titles are one to five words in length.

feature a character called "you".

What do I want to say?

What do I want to tell you?

It's important to vocalize your lyrics.

All hit songs work hard to ensure the listener knows where Beat 1 is.

A word phrase is simply a group of words that expresses an idea.

a melodic phrase is simply a group of notes that expresses a musical idea.

When we speak, we use pitch, rhythm, pace, and volume.

the engine that drives the emotional enjoyment of music is the melodic interplay of tension and release.

Beat 1 and Beat 3 are called strong beats.

Beat 2 and Beat 4 are called weak beats.

An upbeat is a beat between your four beats.

The repetition and organization of rhythm patterns make the melody easy to remember, the changes in pitch and lyrics keep it interesting.

"leading chords" want to keep moving and lead you somewhere.

"home chords" want to stay where they are and not go anywhere.

The only talent you really need to have is the ability to recognize emotional truth.
