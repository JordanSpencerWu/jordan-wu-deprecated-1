description: I like this saying from the book. "He makes his life long by combining all times into one." It's as simple as not wasting time by defining what's important and understanding how past, present, and future correlates to each other. Most importantly, time is our most valuable currency.

title: "ON THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE"
---

We are born for a brief span of life.

"life is short, art is long."

It is not that we have short space of time, but that we waste much of it. Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested.

So, it is - the life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it.

You have all the fears of mortals and all the desires of immortals.

It takes the whole of life to learn how to live, and - what will perhaps make you wonder more - it takes the whole of life to learn how to die.

he who bestows all of his time on his own needs, who plans out every day as if it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the morrow.

Men trifle with the most precious thing in the world; but they are blind to it because it is an incorporeal thing, because it does not come beneath the sight of the eyes, and for this reason it is counted a very cheap thing - nay, of almost no value at all.

no one sets a value on time; all use it lavishly as if it cost nothing.

Postponement is the greatest waste of life; it deprives them of each day as it comes, it snatches from them the present by promising something hereafter.

The greatest hindrance to loving is expectancy, which depends upon the morrow and wastes today.

"Why are you idle? Unless you seize the day, it flees."

Life is divided into three periods - that which has been, that which is, that which will be. Of these the present time is short, the future is doubtful, the past is certain.

He makes his life long by combining all times into one.
