description: The only way to be great is by doing the work. It's more than having passion, it's about investing in getting the skills and knowledge before we have more control over our time. Finding our calling takes time and the journey we remember and value the most is the struggle and hard work we put in.

"Follow your passion is dangerous advice."

When it comes to creating work you love, following your passion is not particularly useful advice.

the importance of ability.

Don't follow your passion; rather, let it follow you in your quest to become so good that they can't ignore you.

##### RULE #1 Don't Follow Your Passion

The Passion Hypothesis: The key to occupational happiness is to first figure out what you're passionate about and then find a job that matches this passion.

"The key thing is to force yourself through the work, force the skills to come; that's the hardest phase.

Compelling careers often have complete origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion.

Career Passions Are Rare

Passion Takes Time

A job is a way to pay the bills, a career is a path toward increasingly better work, and a calling is work that's an important part of your life and a vital part of your identity.

the happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do.

Passion is a side effect of Mastery

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) tells us that motivation requires three basic psychological needs:

1. __Autonomy__: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important.

2. __Competence__: the feeling that you are good at what you do.

3. __Relatedness__: the feeling of connection to other people.

The passion hypothesis is not just wrong, it's also dangerous.

##### RULE #2 Be So Good They Can't Ignore You

the craftsman mindset, a focus on what value you're producing at your job.

creating something meaningful and then presenting it to the world.

Irrespective of what type of work you do, the craftsman mindset is crucial for building a career you love.

"People thrive by focusing on the question of who they really are - and connecting that to work that they truly love."

regardless of how you feel about your job right now, adopting the craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you'll build a compelling career.

you adopt the craftsman mindset first and then the passion follows.

Traits that define great work: Creativity, Impact, and Control.

You need to get good in order to get good things in your working life.

deliberate practice might provide the key to quickly becoming so good they can't ignore you.

##### RULE #3 Turn Down a Promotion

control over what you do, and how you do it, is one of the most powerful traits you can acquire when creating work, you love.

You have to get good before you can expect good work.

Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increase their happiness, engagement, and sense of fulfillment.

Control that's acquired without career capital is not sustainable.

The point at which you have acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control over your working life is exactly the point when you've become valuable enough to your current employer that they will try to prevent you from making the change.

"A leader needs the guts to stand alone and look ridiculous."

"Do what people are willing to pay for."

"Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you're aiming to be valuable."

When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.

##### RULE #4 Think Small, Act Big

great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of using small and achievable projects - little bets - to explore the concrete possibilities surrounding a compelling idea.

career capital is necessary to identify a good mission.

"Rather than believing they have to start with a big idea or plan out a whole project in advance, they make a methodical series of little bets about what might be a good direction, learning critical information from lots of little failures and from small but significant wins."

"The world is full of boring stuff - brown cows - which is why so few people pay attention... A purple cow... now that would stand out. Remarkable marketing is the art of building things worth noticing."

For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be remarkable in two different ways. First, it must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking.
