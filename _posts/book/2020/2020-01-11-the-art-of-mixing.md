description: The art of mixing is about visualizing each sound in your mind and understanding how they fit in the song. We can do this by understanding the tools that changes the volume, pitch, and position of the sound. Remember, the four tools we can use in mixing volume faders, panning, equalization, and effects.

##### Thirteen Aspects of a Recorded Piece of Music

1. Concept
2. Intention
3. Melody
4. Rhythm
5. Harmony
6. Lyrics
7. Density of Arrangement
8. Instrumentation
9. Song Structure
10. Performance (pitch, timing, technique, dynamics, and greatness)
11. Quality of the Equipment and the Recording
12. Hooks
13. The Mix

We relate to sound in two ways: we feel (and hear) the physical sound waves that come out of the speakers, and we imagine the apparent placement of sounds between the speakers.

A sound can be moved around in the space between the speakers by changing the volume, panning, and pitch.

Louder sounds are larger

High frequency sounds are smaller

When you have a delay longer than 30 ms, you hear two signals.

Placing reverb in a mix is like placing the sound of a room in the space between the speakers.

The art of mixing is the appropriate and creative placement and movement of these sound images.

Colors can be assigned to specific frequency ranges.

"Before you begin, it is good to know where you are going."

Don't touch a knob until you know where you are going.

The mix should be appropriate: appropriate for the style of music, appropriate for the song and all of its details, and appropriate for the people involved.

Each style of music has developed its own traditions as to how it is mixed.

The key is to simply listen to what each one of the thirteen aspects in the song is telling you to do in the mix.

You must give total respect and consideration to every single idea that someone comes up with.

Sound creators range from acoustic to electric instruments, from voice to synthesizers.

Sound routers route sound from one place to another.

Storage device stores sound or MIDI information and play it back.

Sound transducers take one form of energy and change it into another.

three components to sound: volume (or amplitude), frequency, and time.

Volume faders control the volume of each sound in the mix, including effects.

The apparent volume of a sound in a mix is based on two main things, the fader level and waveform, and another minor one, the Fletcher/Munson Curve.

Fletcher/Munson Curve says human hearing process is that we don't hear all frequencies at the same volume - especially those at low volumes.

Compression and limiting are volume functions; their main purpose is to turn the volume down.

Limiter stops the volume from getting any louder than the threshold.

A compressor allows the volume to get a bit louder than the threshold based on a ratio, or percentage.

noise gate drops the volume when falls below the threshold, use to get rid of noise, bleed, and to shorten the duration of a sound.

EQ is a change in the volume of a particular frequency of a sound.

The term timbre refers to different sound qualities or tonalities.

panning is a function of left to right.

Echo is a delay time > 100 ms

Slap is a delay time between 60 - 100 ms

Doubling is a delay time between 30 - 60 ms

Fattening is a delay time between 1 - 30 ms

Reverb is hundreds and hundreds of delays

Every mix in the world is created with the same four tools: volume faders, panning, equalization, and effects.

one of the primary functions of a compressor/limiter is the to make a sound more present.

Time-based effects, such as delay, flanging, chorusing, phasing, and reverb, all add more sounds to the mix, filling out the space between the speakers.

the volume of any sound in a mix is always, based on the volume of the sounds that came before it.
