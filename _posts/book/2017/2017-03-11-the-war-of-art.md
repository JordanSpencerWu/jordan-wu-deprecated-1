It's not the writing part that's hard. What's hard is sitting down to write.

We have two lives, the life we live, and the unlived life. What stands between them is Resistance.

##### Book One: RESISTANCE - Defining the Enemy

* RESISTANCE IS INVISIBLE
* RESISTANCE IS INTERNAL
* RESISTANCE IS INSIDIOUS
* RESISTANCE IS IMPLACABLE
* RESISTANCE IS IMPERSONAL
* RESISTANCE IS INFALLIBLE
* RESISTANCE IS UNIVERSAL
* RESISTANCE NEVER SLEEPS
* RESISTANCE PLAYS FOR KEEPS
* RESISTANCE IS FUELED BY FEAR
* RESISTANCE ONLY OPPOSES IN ONE DIRECTION
* RESISTANCE IS MOST POWERFUL AT THE FINISH LINE
* RESISTANCE CAN BE BEATEN

Procrastination is the most common manifestation of Resistance because it's the easiest to rationalize. The most pernicious aspect of procrastination is that it can become a habit. Never forget: This very moment, we can change our lives.

Anything that draws attention to ourselves through pain-free or artificial means is a manifestation of Resistance.

Cruelty to others is a form of Resistance, as is the willing endurance of cruelty from others.

Creating soap opera in our lives is a symptom of Resistance.

Depression and anxiety may be real. But they can also be Resistance.

That the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.

If you find yourself criticizing other people, you're probably doing it out of Resistance. Individuals who are realized in their own lives almost never criticize others.

Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration.

Fear is good. Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator. Fear tells us what we have to do.

The more scared we are of a work or calling, the surer we can be that we have to do it.

Resistance is directly proportional to love. If you're feeling massive Resistance, the good news is, it means there's tremendous love there too.

The professional has learned that success, like happiness, comes as a by-product of work. The professional concentrates on the work and allow rewards to come or not come, whatever they like.

##### Book Two: COMBATING RESISTANCE - Turning Pro

The amateur plays for fun. The professional plays for keeps. The amateur plays part-time, the professional full-time. The amateur is a weekend warrior. The professional is there seven days a week. The professional loves it so much he dedicates his life to it. That's what I mean when I say turning pro. Resistance hates it when we turn pro.

###### Principle of Priority

(a) you must know the difference between what is urgent and what is important, and (b) you must do what's important first.

All of us are pros in one area: our jobs.

###### What qualities defines us a professional?

1. We show up every day.
2. We show up no matter what.
3. We stay on the job all day.
4. We are committed over the long haul.
5. The stakes for us are high and real.
6. We accept remuneration for our labor.
7. We do not overidentify with our jobs.
8. We master the technique of our jobs.
9. We have a sense of humor about our jobs.
10. We receive praise or blame in the real world.

Nothing is as empowering as real-world validation, even if it's for failure.

The professional, though he accepts money, does his work out of love.

The professional arms himself with patience, not only to give the starsâ€™ time to align in his career, but to keep himself from flaming out in each individual work.

The professional eliminates chaos from his world in order to banish it from his mind.

The professional shuts up, doesn't talk about it, and does the work.

The professional knows that fear can never be overcome.

The professional respects Resistance. He knows if he caves in today, no matter how plausible the pretext, he'll be twice as likely to cave in tomorrow.

The professional prepares mentally to absorb blows and to deliver them. His goals are not victory (success will come by itself when it wants to) but to handle himself, his insides, as sturdily and steadily as he can.

A professional does not show off.

The professional respects his craft, he dedicates himself to mastering technique not because he believes technique is a substitute for inspiration but because he wants to be in possession of the full arsenal of skills when inspiration does come.

The professional identifies with her consciousness and her will, not with the matter that her consciousness and will manipulate to serve her art.

The professional cannot take rejection personally because to do so reinforces Resistance.

The professional self-validates.

The professional gives an ear to criticism, seeking to learn and grow.

the professional cannot let himself take humiliation personally.

The professional endures adversity.

The professional keeps his eye on the doughnut and not on the hole.

The professional cannot allow the actions of other to define his reality.

The professional blows critics off.

The professional learns to recognize envy-driven criticism and to take it for what it is: the supreme compliment.

The professional sense who has served his time and who hasn't.

The essence of professionalism is the focus upon the work and its demands, while we are doing it, to the exclusion of all else.

There's no mystery to turning pro. It's a decision brought about by an act of will. We make up our mind to view ourselves as pros and we do it. Simple as that.

##### Book Three: Beyond Resistance: The Higher Real

The most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.

When we sit down each day and do our work, power concentrates around us. When we sit down and work, we become like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come. Insights accrete.

"Eternity is in love with the creations of time" means, these creatures of higher sphere (or the sphere itself, in the abstract) take joy in what we time-bound beings can bring forth into physical existence in our limited material sphere.

Before I sit down to work, I'll take a minute and show respects to this unseen Power who can make or break me.

"Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, magic, and power in it. Begin it now."

You're supposed to learn that things that you think are nothing, as weightless as air, are actually powerful substantial forces, as real and as solid as earth. The eagle was telling me that dreams, visions, meditations such as this very one, things that I had till now disdained as fantasy and illusion, were as real and as solid as anything in my waking life.

The Self, is a greater entity, which includes the Ego, but also incorporates the Personal and Collective Unconscious. Dreams and intuitions come from the Self.

The Self wishes to create, to evolve. The Ego likes things the way they are.

The Ego produces Resistance and attacks the awakening artist.

Resistance feeds on fear.

We're not born with unlimited choices. We come into this world with a specific, personal destiny. Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we already are and become it.

For the artist to define himself hierarchically is fatal. The artist cannot look to others to validate his efforts or his calling.

The act of creation is by definition territorial.

Our orientation is territorial. Here is a test. Of any activity, you do, ask yourself: If I were the last person on earth, would I still do it? It's about the substances we get comes from the act itself, not from the impression it makes on others.

We must do our work for its own sake, not for fortune or attention or applause.

Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. It's a gift to the world and every being in it.
