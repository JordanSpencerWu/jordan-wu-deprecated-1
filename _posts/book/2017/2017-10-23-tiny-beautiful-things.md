This is what I got out of the book. Part of life is living it day by day and we become who we are from our personal experience and surrounding environment. Life can be hard and unpredictable, but that's what makes it unique and fun. Remember we are not alone in this world, there's people who have gone through or is going through the same exact experience as you are at any given moment. Whenever you feel like you're in hell, remind yourself that others have been there and live to tell their story. All our experiences in life will make us stronger and wiser, it helps us see the light when we are blinded without the experience. Our life is unique to us and we always had the power to control where it takes us.
