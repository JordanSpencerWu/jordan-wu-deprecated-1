Remember: Extraordinary people are just ordinary people who are thinking differently and that could be you.

##### 1. EARTH: Grounding Your Thinking - Understand Deeply

In everything you do, refine your skills and knowledge about fundamental concepts and simple cases.

Every return to the basics will deepen your understanding of the entire subject.

When the going gets tough, creative problem solvers create an easier, simpler problem that they can solve.

Whenever you "see" and issue or "understand" a concept, be conscious of the lens through which you're viewing the subject.

To better understand your world, consciously acknowledge what you actually see - no matter how mundane or obvious - rather than guess at what you think you are supposed to see.

Being honest and accurate about what you actually know and don't know forces you to identify and fill gaps in your understanding.

Understanding simple things deeply means mastering the fundamental principles, ideas, and methods that then create a solid foundation on which you can build.

##### 2. FIRE: Igniting Insight through Mistakes - Fail to Succeed

If we have the healthier attitude that failure is a potent teacher and a scheduled stop along the road to success, then we find ourselves liberated to move forward sooner, because mistakes are action we definitely can take at any time.

The next time you face a daunting challenge, think to yourself, "In order for me to resolve this issue, I will have to fail nine times, but on the tenth attempt, I will be successful."

Allow work to grow and evolve through iteratively identifying and improving on previous drafts and missteps.

Mistakes present a great opportunity to learn and improve, but action is required.

We look at a mistake not as a wrong answer, but instead as an opportunity to ask, "What is the question to which this is a correct answer?"

A person who is willing to fail is someone who is willing to step outside the box.

##### 3. AIR: Creating Question out of Thin Air - Be Your Own Socrates

Creating question is as important as answering them, if not more so, because framing good questions focuses your attention on the right issues.

If you want to get more out of what you hear or see, force yourself to ask questions.

With practice, you can learn to take personal responsibility to understand what is being said as it happens in real time, and to actively construct well-founded question about what is missing, what is assumed, what might be extended, or what is vague or unclear.

Ideally, the goal of education should be to develop critical thinking and communication skills and other such mind - strengthening abilities.

##### 4. WATER: Seeing the Flow of Ideas - Look Back, Look Forward

New ideas today are built on the ideas of yesterday and illuminate the way the brilliant ideas of tomorrow.

Once you understand a more advanced topic, look back to see what brought you to where you are.

When you learn a new concept or master a skill, think about what extensions, variations, and applications are possible.

We must get in the habit of seeing each advance as putting us on the lower slope of a much higher peak that has yet to be scaled.

##### 5. THE QUINTESSENTIAL ELEMENT: Engaging Change - Transform Yourself

The goal is to change you into someone who thinks and learns better.

Like the way to happiness, the path to change is not through greater willpower and harder work, but rather through thinking differently.

Don't be afraid to change any part of yourself, you'll still be there, only better.

If the ability to change is part of who you are, then you are liberated from worry about weaknesses or defects, because you can adapt and improve whenever you like.

No matter what your stage in life, you are going to develop strength you do not yet have, and when you do, opportunities will open to you that you have not yet dreamed of.

Whether in school or out, whether young or old, you can choose to be a person who sees boundless opportunities, who enjoys the lifelong process of personal growth and discovery, and who meets challenges and obstacles with innovation and imagination.
