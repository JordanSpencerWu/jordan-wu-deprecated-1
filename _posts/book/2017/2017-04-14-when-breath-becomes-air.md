The physician's duty is not to stave of death or return patient to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face, and make sense of, their own existence.

##### Caelica 83: You that seek what life is in death
<blockquote>
  You that seek what life is in death,<br>
  Now find it air that once was break.<br>
  New names unknown, old names gone:<br>
  Till time end bodies, but souls none.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reader! then make time, while you be,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But steps to your enternity.<br>
  <br>
