title: "THE OBSTACLE IS THE WAY"
---

Our actions may be impeded... but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting.

The impediment to action advances action.
What stands in the way becomes the way?

Whatever we face, we have a choice: Will we be blocked by obstacles, or will we advance through and over them?

It's simple: a method and framework for understanding, appreciating, and acting upon the obstacles life throws at us.

"real philosophers": They had the ability to see obstacles for what they were, the ingenuity to tackle them, and the will to endure a world mostly beyond their comprehension and control.

"The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Never forget, within every obstacle is an opportunity to improve our conditions."

When you have a goal, obstacles are actually teaching you how to get where you want to go, carving you a path.

<blockquote>
  Objective judgement, now at this very moment.<br>
  Unselfish action, now at this very moment.<br>
  Willing acceptance, now at this very moment of all external events.<br>
  That's all you need.
</blockquote>

Overcoming obstacles is a discipline of three critical steps. It begins with how we look at our specific problems, our attitude or approach; then the energy and creativity with which we actively break them down and turn them into opportunities; finally, the cultivation and maintenance of an inner will that allows us to handle defeat and difficulty. (__Perception__, __Action__, and the __Will__)

<blockquote>
  First, see clearly.<br>
  Next, act correctly.<br>
  Finally, endure and accept the world as it is.<br>
  <br>
  see things for what they are.<br>
  Do what we can.<br>
  Endure and bear what we must<br>
  <br>
  What blocked the path now is a path.<br>
  What once impeded action advances action.<br>
  The Obstacle is the Way.
</blockquote>

  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-book" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Perception</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      <p>It's how we see and understand what occurs around us and what we decide those events will mean.</p>

      <p>You will come across obstacles in life fair and unfair. And you will discover, time and time again, that what matters most is not what these obstacles are but how we see them, how we react to them, and whether we keep our composure. You will learn that this reaction determines how successful we will be in overcoming or possibly thriving because of them.</p>

      <p>You must realize: Nothing makes us feel this way; we choose to give in to such feelings.</p>

      <p>We can see opportunity in every disaster, and transform that negative situation into an education, a skill set, or a fortune.</p>

      <h5>Few things to keep in mind when faced with an obstacle:</h5>

      <ol>
        <li>To be objective</li>
        <li>To control emotions and keep an even keel</li>
        <li>To choose to see the good in a situation</li>
        <li>To steady our nerves</li>
        <li>To ignore what disturbs or limits other</li>
        <li>To place things in perspective</li>
        <li>To revert to the present moment</li>
        <li>To focus on what can be controlled</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Our perceptions are the thing that we're in complete control of.</p>

      <p>If we have our wits fully about us, we can step back and remember that situations, by themselves, cannot be good or bad. This is something a judgment that we, as human beings, bring to them with our perceptions.</p>

      <p>"Nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."</p>

      <p>There is always a countermove, always an escape or a way through, so there is no reason to get worked up. No one said it would be easy and, of course, the stakes are high, but the path is there for those ready to take it.</p>

      <p>Obstacle make us emotional, but the only way we'll survive or overcome them is by keeping those emotions in check.</p>

      <p>We defeat emotions with logic, in other words, questions and statements.</p>

      <h5>Perspective has two definitions</h5>

      <ol>
        <li>Context: a sense of the larger picture of the world, not just what is immediately in front of us.</li>
        <li>Framing: an individual's unique way of looking at the world, a way that interprets its events.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The difference between the right and the wrong perspective is everything. Perception precedes action. Right action follows the right perspective.</p>

      <p>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference.</p>

      <h5>What is up to us?</h5>

      <ol>
        <li>Our emotions</li>
        <li>Our judgement</li>
        <li>Our creativity</li>
        <li>Our attitude</li>
        <li>Our perspective</li>
        <li>Our desires</li>
        <li>Our decisions</li>
        <li>Our determination</li>
      </ol>

      <p>To see an obstacle as a challenge, to make the best of it anyway, that is also a choice, a choice that is up to us.</p>

      <p>Remember that this moment is not your life, it's just a moment in your life.</p>

      <p>After you have controlled your emotions, and you can see objectively and stand steadily, the next step becomes possible: a mental flip, so you're looking not at the obstacle but at the opportunity within it.</p>

      <p>"There is good in everything, if only we look for it."</p>

      <p>It's our preconceptions that are the problem. They tell us that things should or need to be a certain way, so when they're not, we naturally assume that we are at the disadvantage or that we'd be wasting our time to pursue an alternate course. When really, it's all fair game, and every situation is an opportunity for us to act.</p>

      <p>The obstacle is an advantage, not adversity. The enemy is any perception that prevents us from seeing this.</p>

      <p>Everything can be flipped, seen with this kind of gaze: a piercing look that ignores the package and see only the gift. This must be a complete flip. Seeing through the negative, past its underside, and into its corollary: the positive.</p>

      <p>Once you see the world as it is, for what it is, you must act.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-book" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">ACTION</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      <p>Our movements and decisions define us: We must be sure to act with deliberation, boldness, and persistence. Those are the attributes of right and effective action. Action is the solution and the cure to our predicaments.</p>

      <p>We forget: In life, it doesn't matter what happens to you or where you came from. It matters what you do with what happens and what you've been given. And the only way you'll do something spectacular is by using it all to your advantage.</p>

      <h5>We can always (and only) greet our obstacles:</h5>

      <ol>
        <li>with energy</li>
        <li>with persistence</li>
        <li>with a coherent and deliberate process</li>
        <li>with iteration and resilience</li>
        <li>with pragmatism</li>
        <li>with strategic vision</li>
        <li>with craftiness and savvy</li>
        <li>and an eye for opportunity and pivotal moments</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The first step is: Take the bat off your shoulder and give it a swing. You've got to start, to go anywhere.</p>

      <p>The final part: Stay moving, always</p>

      <p>We all know from history that those who attack problems and life with the most initiative and energy usually win.</p>

      <p>Just because the conditions aren't exactly to your liking, or you don't feel ready yet, doesn't mean you get a pass. If you want momentum, you'll have to create it yourself, right now, by getting up and getting started.</p>

      <p>We will not be stopped by failure, we will not be rushed or distracted by external noise. We will chisel and peg away at the obstacle until it is gone. Resistance is futile.</p>

      <h5>Consider this mind-set:</h5>

      <ol>
        <li>never in a hurry</li>
        <li>never worried</li>
        <li>never desperate</li>
        <li>never stopping short</li>
      </ol>

      <p>"persist and resist." Persist in your efforts. Resist giving in to distraction, discouragement, or disorder.</p>

      <p>Failure really can be an asset if what you're trying to do is improve, learn, or do something new.</p>

      <p>Action and failure are two sides of the same coin. One doesn't come without the other.</p>

      <p>Failure shows us the way by showing us what isn't the way.</p>

      <p>Follow the process and not the prize. The process is about finishing</p>

      <p>The process is order, it keeps our perceptions in check and our actions in sync.</p>

      <p>The process is about doing the right things, right now.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, on the road to where we are going or where we want to be, we have to do things that we'd rather not do.</p>

      <p>Everything we do matters. Everything is a chance to do and be your best.</p>

      <p>Wherever we are, whatever we're doing and wherever we are going, we owe it to ourselves, to our act, to the world to do it well.</p>

      <p>In every situation, life is asking us a question, and our actions are the answer.</p>

      <p>Opposites work. Nonaction can be action. So instead of fighting obstacles, find a means of making them defeat themselves.</p>

      <p>Sometimes in your life you need to have patience, wait for temporary obstacles to fizzle out.</p>

      <p>We wrongly assume that moving forward is the only way to progress, the only way we can win. Sometimes, staying put, going sideways, or moving backward is actually the best way to eliminate what blocks or impedes your path.</p>

      <p>Adversity can harden you. Or it can loosen you up and make you better, if you let it.</p>

      <p>External factors influence the path, but not the direction: forward.</p>

      <p>It's at the seemingly bad moments, when people least expect it, that we can act swiftly and unexpectedly to pull off a big victory.</p>

      <p>Ordinary people shy away from negative situation, just as they do with failure. They do their best to avoid trouble. What great people do is the opposite. They are their best in these situations. They turn personal tragedy or misfortune, really anything, everything to their advantage.</p>

      <p>Do we accept this as an exclusively negative event, or can we get past whatever negativity or adversity it represents and mount an offensive? Or more precisely, can we see that this "problem" presents an opportunity for a solution that we have long been waiting for?</p>

      <p>Nothing can ever prevent us from trying. Ever.</p>

      <p>In every situation, that which blocks our path actually presents a new path with a new part of us.</p>

      <p>We have it within us to be the type of people who try to get things done, try with everything we've got and, whatever verdict comes in, are ready to accept it instantly and move on to whatever it next.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-book" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">WILL</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      <p>Placed in some situation that seems unchangeable and undeniably negative, we can turn it into a learning experience, a humbling experience, a chance to provide comfort to others.</p>

      <p>We must prepare for adversity and turmoil, we must learn the art of acquiescence and practice cheerfulness even in dark times.</p>

      <p>True will is quiet humility, resilience, and flexibility; the other kind of will is weakness disguised by bluster and ambition.</p>

      <p>If Perception and Action were the disciplines of the mind and the body, then Will is the discipline of the heart and the soul. The will is the one thing we control completely, always.</p>

      <p>Will is fortitude and wisdom: the strength to endure, contextualize, and derive meaning from the obstacle we cannot simply overcome.</p>

      <p>Certain things in life will cut you open like a knife. When that happens, at that exposing moment, the world gets a glimpse of what's truly inside you.</p>

      <p>We can think, act, and finally adjust to a world that is inherently unpredictable.</p>

      <p>Confident, calm, ready to work regardless of the conditions. Willing and able to continue, even during the unthinkable, even when our worst nightmares have come true.</p>

      <h5>In every situation, we can:</h5>

      <ol>
        <li>Always prepare ourselves for more difficult times.</li>
        <li>Always accept what we're unable to change.</li>
        <li>Always manage our expectations.</li>
        <li>Always persevere.</li>
        <li>Always lean to love our fate and what happens to us.</li>
        <li>Always protect our inner self, retreat into ourselves.</li>
        <li>Always submit to a greater, larger cause.</li>
        <li>Always remind ourselves of our own mortality.</li>
        <li>And, of course, prepare to start the cycle once more.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We craft our spiritual strength through physical exercise, and our physical hardiness through mental practice.</p>

      <p>To do great things, we need to be able to endure tragedy and setbacks. We've got to love what we do and all that it entails, good and bad. we have to learn to find joy in every single thing that happens.</p>

      <p>Accept what happens to us, after understanding that certain things, particularly bad things, are outside our control, is this: loving whatever happens to us and facing it with unfailing cheerfulness.</p>

      <p>Stop making it harder on yourself by thinking about I, I, I. Stop putting that dangerous "I" in front of events. I did this. I was so smart, I had that. I deserve better than this. No wonder you take losses personally, no wonder you feel so alone. You've inflated your own role and importance.</p>

      <p>Whatever you're going through, whatever is holding you down or standing in your way, can be turned into a source of strength, by thinking of people other than yourself.</p>

      <p>Death doesn't make life pointless, but rather purposeful.</p>

      <p>Thinking about and being aware of our mortality creates real perspective and urgency.</p>

      <p>Reminding ourselves each day that we will die helps us treat our time as a gift.</p>

      <p>Knowing that life is a marathon and not a sprint is important.</p>
