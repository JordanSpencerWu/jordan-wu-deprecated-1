We all seem to agree genius begins with feats of mental greatness.

Optimal performance is about being your best; ultimate performance is about being your best when any mistake could kill.

A rare and radical state of consciousness where the impossible becomes possible. The zone, quite literally, is the shortest path toward superman.

High-risk activity can profoundly alter consciousness and significantly enhance mental abilities.

Mindset impacts emotion, which alters biology, which increases performance.

"Every good athlete can find the flow, but it's what you do with it that makes you great. If you consistently use that state to do the impossible, you get confident in your ability to do the impossible. You begin to expect it. That's why we're seeing so much progression in action sports today. It's the natural result of a whole lot of people starting to expect the impossible."

"During a peak experience, the individual experiences an expansion of self, a sense of unity, and meaningfulness in life. The experience lingers in one's consciousness and gives a sense of purpose, integration, self-determination and empathy."

"Flow states being so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter. The ego falls away. Times flies. Every action, movement and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you're using your skills to the utmost."

In all other activities, flow is the hallmark of high performance, but in situation where the slightest error could be fatal, then perfection is the only choice - and flow is the only guarantee of perfection.

Three of the basic properties of flow: the profound mental clarity provided by the state; the emotional detachment that tends to accompany this clarity; and a hint of its automatic nature - how one right decision always leads to the next right decision.

Flow packs a double punch: it doesn't just increase our decision-making abilities - it increases our creative decision-making abilities.

The Voice - the voice of intuition - the center of the zone's mystery.

Flow states significantly enhance performance: when the "self" disappears, it takes many of our limits along for the ride.

Flow is a fluid action state, making better decision isn't enough: we also have to act on those decision.

Flow is the rush of possibility: a product of radical neurochemical, neuroelectric, and neuroanatomical function triggering whole-body transformation.

If we really want to be our best, we don't just have to rethink the path toward mastery; we need to reconsider the way we live our lives.

Deliberate well-structure practices is a rigorous, compliance-based approach to mastery.

Flow doesn't just provide a joyful, self-directed path toward mastery - it literally shortens the path.

If we want more flow in our lives, the best place to start that investigation is with the people with the most flow in their lives.

"If you're interested in mastery, you have to learn this lesson. To really achieve anything, you have to be able to tolerate and enjoy risk. It has to become a challenge to look forward to. In all fields, to make exceptional discoveries you need risk - you're just never going to have a breakthrough without it."

"To reach flow, one must be willing to take risks. The lover must lay bare his soul and risk rejection and humiliation to enter this state. The athlete must be willing to risk physical harm, even loss of life, to enter this state. The artist must be willing to be scorned and despised by critics and the public and still push on. And the average person - you and me - must be willing to fail, look foolish, and fall flat on our faces should we wish to enter this state."

When the brain is charged with a clear goal, focus narrows considerably, the unimportant is disregarded, and the now is all that's left.

Flow channel - the spot where the task is hard enough to make us stretch but not hard enough to make us snap.

A growth mindset is one of the secrets to maximizing the total amount of flow in your life.

The people who participated in group flow were the highest performers.

Flow enhances creativity, the process of developing original ideas that have value.

The combination of autonomy (the desire to direct your own life), mastery (the desire to learn, explore, and be creative), and purpose (the desire to matter, to contribute to the world) are our most powerful intrinsic drivers - the three things that motivate us most.

Life is long and we're all scared and, in flow, at least for a little while, we're not.

When innovation leads to death, powerful tradition ensures that death leads to more innovation.

Flow is a creation engine: it helps us pluck an idea out of imagination and bring it fully formed into the world.

After something has been done once, it becomes considerably easier to repeat.

Once we can actually see ourselves doing the impossible, our chance of pulling it off increases significantly.

We all see farther by standing on the shoulders of giants.

"The ability to learn faster than your competitors is the only sustainable competitive advantage."

Flow brings out the very best in us - and for certain, it's that very best we'll need to create a world of abundance.
