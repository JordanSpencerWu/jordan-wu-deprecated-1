Our goal is to find work that feels like play, yet also has a meaning and a good paycheck attached to it. In other words, finding what you were meant to do. There will be many paths and it will take time and effort to find the work we are meant to do. This path is not linear and will have many twists and turns, remember we want to make the right decision along the way.

##### JOY-MONEY-FLOW is the 3 key components of a lottery-winning career

1. Something that makes us happy (joy)

2. Something that's financially viable (money)

3. Something that maximizes our unique skills (flow)

All of the big career decisions you make should get you closer to your ideal blend of joy, money, and flow, and there's an important distinction between the content of your job and career (the kind of work you do) and the working condition (how you do it).

To be luckier, take better chances. Remember, it's not just a numbers game. It's about managing your risk by picking the right numbers in the first place. Successful people are best positioned for success when they focus not just on improving their skills, but on improving the right skills.

When you're not sure what your "thing" is, when you don't know quite where to look to find that job or career, that brings you joy, flow, and a good income, the people you talk to every day can help you find it. The goal is to make career changes that bring happiness and income. Finding your dream career isn't about what you can do, it's about what you should do.

Side hustle: You don't have to quit your job to start something on the side, and it doesn't have to take over your life unless you want it to.

The principle from sociology called "the strength of weakness", our acquaintance can open more doors to more people, and thus introduce us to more opportunities, than our friends can.

Success isn't found completely in persistence; it's found in working hard and smart.

No matter which network or platform or tool you use to reach people, the most important goal is to be authentic and genuine.

Those who succeed in the new economy share four specific characteristics: a body of work (product), a group of fans (audience), a means of sharing the body of work (platform), and a way of getting paid for their work (money).

Work shifting is different from multitasking it's where you navigate multiple projects and interest by focusing fully on something for a while, and then deliberately shifting to focus fully on something else.

For someone to win, many others have to lose.
