description: This book helps you understand what it means to be original in business. Many of us probably go with the default, but once we understand that there are better options. We will think of great ideas that will improve existing products, services, or processes. The world needs more originals without them nothing will change.

#### Creative Destruction

Originality involves introducing and advancing an idea that's relatively unusual within a particular domain, and that has the potential to improve it.

The hallmark of originality is rejecting the default and exploring whether a better option exists.

When we become curious about the dissatisfying default in our world, we begin to recognize that most of them have social origins: Rules and systems were created by people.

Having a sense of security in one realm gives us the freedom to be original in another.

#### Blind Inventors and One-Eyed Investors

We tend to be over confident when we evaluate ourselves.

False positive: it was forecast as a hit but turned out to be a miss.

False negative: it was expected to fail but ultimately flourished.

Many people fail to achieve originality because they generate a few ideas and then obsess about refining them to perfection.

As we gain knowledge about a domain, we become prisoners of our prototypes. The more expertise and experience people gain, the more entrenched they become in a particular way of viewing the world.

We crave acceptance by our peer group, those similar to us. We're also drawn to peer evaluations because they provide the most reliable judgements.

To be successfully original, an invention needs to be new - but it also has to be practical.

Intuition operates rapidly, based on hot emotions, whereas reason is a slower, cooler process.

#### Out on a Limb

Power involves exercising control or authority over others; status is being respected and admired.

People were punished for trying to exercise power without status.

If we want people to accept our original ideas, we need to speak up about them, then rinse and repeat.

Exposure effect: the more often we encounter something, the more we like it.

If we could do things over, most of us would censor ourselves less and express our ideas more.

#### Fools Rush In

Procrastination might be conducive to originality.

Delaying progress enabled people to spend more time considering different ways to accomplish it, rather than "seizing and freezing" on one particular strategy.

Procrastination may be the enemy of productivity, but it can be a resource for creativity.

People of "genius sometimes accomplish most when they work the least, for they are thinking out inventions and forming in their minds the perfect idea."

Zeigarnik effect: people have a better memory for incomplete than complete tasks.

"Timing accounted for forty-two percent of the difference between success and failure.

Moving first is a tactic, not a goal, being the first mover doesn't do you any good if someone else comes along and unseats you.

Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it.

Experimental innovators solve problems through trial and error, learning and evolving as they go along.

#### Goldilocks and the Trojan Horse

"It is precisely the minor differences in people who are otherwise alike that form the basis of feeling of strangeness and hostility between them."

If you were a true believer, you'd be all in. The more strongly you identify with an extreme group, the harder you seek to differentiate yourself from more moderate groups that threaten your values.

In seeking alliances with groups that share our values, we overlook the importance of sharing our strategic tactics.

If we want to inspire people, we should start with why.

Frenemies - people who sometimes support you and sometimes undermine you.

Cur our frenemies and attempt to convert our enemies.

"A person whose liking for us increases over time will be liked better than one who has always liked us."

"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."

#### Rebel with a Cause

When we use the logic consequence, we can always find reasons not to take risk.

The logic of appropriateness free us up. We think less about what will guarantee the outcome we want, and act more on a visceral sense of what someone like us ought to do.

"Firstborns are more risk averse than laterborns."

Although firstborns tend to be more dominant, conscientious, and ambitious, laterborns are more open to taking risks and embracing original ideas.

Niche picking helps to solve the mystery of why siblings aren't terribly similar; laterborn children actively seek to be different.

Parents of highly creative children outlined their standards of conduct and explained their grounding in a set of principles about right and wrong, referencing values like morality, integrity, respect, curiosity, and perseverance.

Character praise leaves a lasting imprint when identities are forming.

#### Rethinking Groupthink

Groupthink is the enemy of originality; people feel pressured to conform to the dominant, default views instead of championing diversity of thought.

Groupthink occurs when people "are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group," and their "striving for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action."

The professional blueprint emphasized hiring candidates with specific skills.

The star blueprint focus on placing a premium on choosing or poaching the brightest hires.

The commitment blueprint main priority was to employ people who matched the company's values and norms.

Strong culture has a harder time recognizing the need for change, and they're more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently.

"Minority viewpoint are important, not because they tend to prevail but because they stimulate divergent attention and thought."

"Don't let loyalty stand in the way of truth and openness."

"Argue like you're right and listen like you're wrong."

"You gain believability by other believable people saying you're believable."

"Shapers" are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and rebellious.

#### Rocking the Boat and Keeping It Steady

Strategic optimists anticipate the best, staying calm and setting high expectations.

Defensive pessimists expect the worst, feeling anxious and imagining all the things that can go wrong.

Fear is marked by uncertainty about the future: We're worried that something bad will happen.

Originality brings more bumps in the road, yet it leaves us with more happiness and a greater sense of meaning.

"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world, indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."
