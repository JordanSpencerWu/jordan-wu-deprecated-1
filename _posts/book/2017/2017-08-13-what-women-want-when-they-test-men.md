title: "WHAT WOMEN WANT WHEN THEY TEST MEN"
---

A woman's behavior: the subconscious need to test a man to determine his capability to lead and capacity to love her.

Many women prefer to be with a man who isn't afraid to stand up to them, who challenges them, and refuses to be pushed around when a woman tests him.

What she's more concerned about on a deep, primal level is: "Are you man enough to lead and love me?"

The more secure a woman feels around you the less she's going to test you in order to gain reassurance of your congruence or commitment.

The more attraction a woman feels for you the more she's going to test you in order to experience playful display of your masculinity.

You must learn to embrace rejection and enjoy conflict.

When a woman tests you, she wants to establish your quality as a man, how will you perform in certain situation in the future, and whether or not she can rely on you.

High-quality woman learns very quickly that the path to future relationship bliss is highly dependent on a man's ability to stand up for himself.

A congruence test determines whether or not a man is, at his core, congruent with what he's presenting to her.

Woman use compliance tests to figure out how compliant a man is with her needs and wants as opposed to his own.

Women use commitment tests to gain some assurance on the level of a man's commitment to them.

Being a man 'in control' means that you are able to display grace under pressure while in the midst of difficult situations.

Your frame is a set of self-beliefs that determine how you define the outside world in relation to yourself.

Men who always give women what they want and who let them get away with bad behavior are repulsive to women.

She needs to be convinced that you're convinced that you're the one wearing the pants in the relationship.

By cowering in fear of her emotions you're actually signaling to her that she possesses the authority in the relationship and that you'll do just about anything to avoid her wrath, sadness, moodiness, or rejection.

The best way to a man can tell if he wears the pants in his relationship or not is how he interacts with his woman when he knows without a shadow of a doubt that she won't approve of his words or actions.

If a woman's emotional state determines how honest you are you're not living your life by your principles, you're living it based on her approval.

A strong masculine man follows through with the truth no matter the consequences and he's willing to suffer pain for the truth.

To respond with masculine strength means you're responding from YOUR core values, standards, and beliefs, not hers.

Sticking to your guns is an idiom that means you refuse to compromise or change, despite criticism.

You must ask yourself, "Am I acting like a man of integrity or am I being conflict-avoidant like a frightened child who thinks he's in trouble?"

A wise man knows when to remain steadfast and when to change his course in order to benefit not just himself, but those under his care as well.

Women love men who are certain that they're going to get exactly what they want.

Conflict crafts a man's character; therefore, avoiding it entirely won't make you any better.

It's important for a man to understand the difference between living based on his principles and living based on a woman's approval.

If a man spends most of his time trying to do everything he thinks a woman wants him to do, he's already failed.

Having a mindset that there is no "right" or "wrong" in how you interact with your woman is powerful because it set you free from trying to please her every time you relate with her.

As a man, you must define your standards and then train your woman to respect the way you do things.

Remember, a quality woman wants your honesty even if it does reveal your discomfort.

To put it simply, for a man to display true strength he needs to be honest with how much he's willing to tolerate.

Be honest with what you're willing to tolerate and be willing to walk away.

You must forgive but you must also set strong boundaries and assert yourself. Be a man of poise and authority.

If you want to make better decisions in your interactions with women, master your own emotions so that you never find yourself afraid of hers.

A woman wants a man who leads with compassion and who loves with passion.

Relationships are meant to be a place of healing and growth.

The ONLY way you can tell if a woman is comfortable and open to letting you lead her is the man whose authority she can submit to is by setting your own boundaries with her and refusing to engage her on her terms.

A quality woman is more than willing to stand by her man through thick and thin so long as he's already proven himself as being worthy of her support.

Focus your energy on becoming a strong, self-assured man at your core.

Nice Guys, male doormats, and conflict-avoidant men are petrified of being "misunderstood" or disliked, especially by women.

Framing, the awareness that the most sacred thing about a man is the integrity of his own mind. It's the notation that a man must have such a strong conviction of his core values that nothing in his external environment can shake him or his self-belief or remove him from his path.

Develop rock-solid self-belief by becoming a better man.

Remember, in order for a man to fully loving a woman he must overcome his fear of her emotions.

Woman want to be loved by a man who leads. Any effort to seduce her or win her heart with romance will only backfire if she doesn't already respect you as a man.
