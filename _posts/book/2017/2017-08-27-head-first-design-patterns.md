##### The Strategy Pattern

<blockquote>
  Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
</blockquote>

__Design Principle:__

Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. In other words, take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don't.

Program to an interface, not an implementation.

Favor composition over inheritance.
