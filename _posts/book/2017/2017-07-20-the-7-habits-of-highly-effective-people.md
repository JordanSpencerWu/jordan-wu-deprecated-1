title: "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"
---

We must look at the lens through which we see the world, as well as at the world we see, and that the lens itself shapes how we interpret the world.

You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut.

Two main categories for maps: maps of the way things are or realities, and maps of the way things should be, or values.

The way we see things is the source of the way we think and the way we act.

We see the world, not as it is, but as we are - or, as we conditioned to see it.

Our paradigms, correct or incorrect, are the sources of our attitudes and behaviors, and ultimately our relationships with others.

Listening involves patience, openness, and the desire to understand - highly developed qualities of character.

"Inside-out" means to start first with self; even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self - with your paradigms, your character, and your motives.

Real self-respect comes from dominion over self, from true independence.

Interdependence is a choice only independent people can make.

The techniques and skills that really make a difference in human interaction are the ones that almost naturally flow from a truly independent character.

As we become independent - proactive, centered in correct principles, value driven and able to organized and execute around the priorities in our life with integrity - we then can choose to become interdependent - capable of building rich, enduring, highly productive relationships with other people.

When we truly love others without condition, without strings, we help them feel secure and safe and validated and affirmed in their essential worth, identity, and integrity.

It's about transactional to transformational.

##### Habit 1: Be Proactive

Between stimulus and response, man has the freedom to choose.

"I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday."

By working on ourselves instead of worrying about conditions, we were able to influence the conditions.

The problems we face fall in one of three areas: direct control (problems involving our own behavior); indirect control (problems involving other people's behavior); or no control (problems we can do nothing about, such as our past or situational realities).

Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do something about.

Reactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Concern. They focus on the weakness of other people, the problems in the environment, and circumstances over which they have no control.

"Lord, give me the courage to change the things which can and ought to be changed, the serenity to accept the things which cannot be changed, and the wisdom to know the difference."

While we are free to choose our actions, we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions.

The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly, correct and learn from it.

It is not what other do or even our own mistakes that hurt us the most, it is our response to those things.

It is here that we find two ways to put ourselves in control of our lives immediately. We can make a promise - and keep it. Or we can set a goal - and work to achieve it.

##### Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind

To begin with the end in mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination.

"Begin with the end in mind." is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There's a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation, to all things.

There's two parts, personal leadership (first creation) and management (second creation).

"Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things."

An understanding of the principle of our own growth enables us to search out correct principles with the confidence that the more we learn, the more clearly, we can focus the lens through which we see the world.

##### Habit 3: Put First Things First

Effective management is putting first things first.

Organize and execute around priorities.

The heart of effective personal management is to deal with things that are not urgent, but are important.

##### Habit 4: Think WIN-WIN

Win/Win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seek mutual benefit in all human interactions.

Anything less than Win/Win in an interdependent reality is a poor second best that will have impact in the long-term relationship.

##### Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, then to be Understood

Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.

empathic listening means listening with intent to understand.

The essence of empathic listening is not that you agree with someone; it's that you fully, deeply, understand that person, emotionally as well as intellectually.

The key to good judgement is understanding.

Seek first to understand. Before the problems come up, before you try to evaluate and prescribe, before you try to present your own ideas - seek to understand.

##### Habit 6: SYNERGIZE

Synergy means that the whole is greater than the sum of its part.

The essence of synergy is to value differences - to respect them, to build on strengths, to compensate for weaknesses.

Valuing the differences is the essence of synergy - the mental, the emotional, the psychological difference between people.

The person who is truly effective has the humility and reverence to recognize his own perceptual limitations and to appreciate the rich resources available through interaction with the hearts and minds of other human beings.

There's almost always a third alternative, and if you work with a Win/Win philosophy and really seek to understand, you usually can find a solution that will be better for everyone concerned.

##### Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw

It's about renewing the four dimensions of your nature - physical, spiritual, mental, and social/emotional.
