description: As the book stated, "Gender insight helps us to be more tolerant and forgiving when someone doesn't respond the way we think he or she should." We too often blame our problems on our partners rather than our own approach. Only when we respect and accept our difference will love blossom.

Men often complain, she is over-reacting and women complain, he doesn't listen!

Only when we do not understand one another is there tension, resentment, or conflict.

When men and women are able to respect and accept their differences then love has a chance to blossom.

A man's sense of self is defined through his ability to achieve results.

To offer a man unsolicited advice is to presume that he doesn't know what to do or that he can't do it on his own.

A women's sense of self is defined through her feelings and the quality of her relationships.

Generally speaking, when a woman offers unsolicited advice or tries to "help" a man, she has no idea of how critical and unloving she may sound to him.

Many times, a woman just wants to share her feelings about her day, and her husband, thinking he is helping, interrupts her by offering a steady flow of solutions to her problems.

When our partner resists us, it is probably because we have made a mistake in our timing or approach.

To feel better Martians, go to their caves to solve problems alone.

To feel better Venusians, get together and openly talk about their problems.

A woman under stress is not immediately concerned with finding solutions to her problems but rather seeks relief by expressing herself and being understood.

To forget her own painful feelings a woman may become emotionally involve in the problems of others.

Just as a man is fulfilled through working out the intricate details of solving a problem, a woman is fulfilled through talking about the details of her problems.

Men are motivated and empowered when they feel needed... Women are motivated and empowered when they feel cherished...

Given the opportunity to prove his potential, a man expresses his best self. Only when he feels he cannot succeed does he regress back to his old selfish ways.

Not to be needed is a slow death for a man.

A woman's tendency to be compulsive relaxes as she remembers that she is worthy of love - she doesn't have to earn it; she can relax, give less, and receive more. She deserves it.

When she wakes up and remembers her needs, he also wakes up and wants to give her more.

A man's deepest fear is that he is not good enough or that he is incompetent.

Just as women are afraid of receiving, men are afraid of giving.

It is difficult for a man to listen to a woman when she is unhappy or disappointed because he feels like a failure.

The number one complaint women have in relationships is: "I don't feel heard." Even this complaint is misunderstood by men!

The biggest challenge for women is correctly to interpret and support a man when he isn't talking.

When a man is silent it is easy for a woman to imagine the worst.

When a man loves a woman, periodically he needs to pull away before he can get closer.

A man automatically alternates between needing intimacy and autonomy.

To a certain extent a man loses himself through connecting with his partner.

The man grows to understand his own cycles and reassures her when he pulls away that he will be back.

A woman's self-esteem rises and falls like a wave. When she hits bottom it is a time for emotional house cleaning.

In relationships, men pull back and then get close, while women rise and fall in their ability to love themselves and others.

Even when a man is succeeding in supporting a woman she may become even more upset.

When negative feelings are suppressed positive feelings become suppressed as well, and love dies.

Men argue for the right to be free while women argue for the right to be upset. Men want space while women want understanding.

By supporting her need to be heard she could support his need to be free.

It puts too much pressure on a man to make him the only source of love and support.

As a woman's financial needs are fulfilled she becomes more aware of her emotional needs.

Men primarily need trust, acceptance, appreciation, admiration, approval, and encouragement.

Women primarily need caring, understanding, respect, devotion, validation, and reassurance.

The secret of empowering a man is never to try to change him or improve him.

The best way to help a man grow is to let go of trying to change him in any way.

Just as communication is the most important element in a relationship, arguments can be the most destructive element.

Intimidation always weakens trust in a relationship.

Men rarely say "I'm sorry" because on Mars it means you have done something wrong and you are apologizing.

Most arguments escalate when a man begins to invalidate a women's feelings and she responds to him disapprovingly.

The most common way women unknowingly start arguments is by not being direct when they share their feelings.

Most arguments occur not because two people disagree but because either the man feels that the women disapproves of his point of view or the woman disapproves of the way he is talking to her.

Men are most prone to argue when they have made a mistake or upset the women they love.

When a woman keep score, no matter how big or small a gift or love is, it scores one point; each gift has equal value.

Most men strive for greater and greater success because they believe it will make them worthy of love.

If a man has made a mistake and feels embarrassed, sorry, or ashamed, then he needs her love more... The bigger the mistake, the more points he gives.

When a man is in a negative state, treat him like a passing tornado and lie low.

Response Letters are the best way to teach a man about a women's needs.

The success of a relationship is solely dependent on two factors: a man's ability to listen lovingly and respectfully to a woman's feelings, and a woman's ability to share her feeling in a loving and respectful way.

Ironically, the very act of avoiding our negative emotions give them the power to control our lives.

To grow in our ability to love ourselves we need to receive love as well.

On Venus, their motto is "Love is never having to ask!"

It a woman is not asking for support a man assumes he is giving enough.

When a man hears a demanding tone, not matter how nicely you phrase your request, all he hears is that he is not giving enough. His tendency is then to give less until you appreciate what he is already giving.

When asking a man for support, assume that he doesn't have to be convinced.

Men are much more willing to say yes if they have the freedom to say no.

When you ask a man for support and you do not reject him for saying no, he will remember that, and next time he will be much more willing to give.

When a man grumbles, it is a good sign - he is trying to consider your request versus his needs.

One of the key elements of assertive asking is to remain silent after you have asked for support.

Men are happiest when they feel they have succeeded in fulfilling the people they care about.

It is a paradox: because you feel safe with your partner, your deepest fears have a chance to surface. When they surface you become afraid and are unable to share what you feel.
