title: "The Power of MEANING - Finding Fulfillment in A World Obsessed with Happiness"
---

Two paths to the good life. The first is hedonia (happiness). Human beings, "strive after happiness; they want to become happy and to remain so." "The art of life lies in taking pleasures as they pass, and the keenest pleasures are not intellectual, nor are they always moral." Meaning is the other path to the good life, the concept of eudaimonia, leading a eudaimonic life, requires cultivating the best qualities within you both morally and intellectually and living up to your potential. The distinction is hedonia is defined as "feeling good," while eudaimonia is defined as "being and doing good." Those who choose to pursue meaning untimely live fuller and happier lives.

The search for meaning is for more fulfilling than the pursuit of personal happiness.

There are sources of meaning all around us, and by tapping into them, we can all lead richer and more satisfying lives and help others do the same.

Happiness and unhappiness did not predict suicide. The variable that did was meaning or, more precisely, the lack of it.

Many people die for meaning: some kill themselves because they judge their lives to be worthless, while others sacrifice their lives for their ideals.

"Life has no meaning a priori.... It's up to you to give it a meaning, and value is nothing but the meaning that you choose."

Everyone needs some "thing," some project or goal, to which he chooses to dedicate his life.

Only by facing challenges head-on can we truly find meaning in our lives.

Meaning arises from transcending the self. "A thing has significance only through its relation as part to a larger whole, then, thought we cannot give a metaphysical and universal meaning to all life in general, we can say of any life in particular that its meaning lies in relation to something larger than itself."

Four pillars of meaning: belonging, purpose, storytelling, and transcendence.

We all need to feel that we belong.

If we want to find meaning in our own lives, we have to begin by reaching out.

Purpose is a "stable and far-reaching" goal that involves a contribution to the world.

"A part of one's personal search for meaning, but it also has an external component, the desire to make a difference in the world, to contribute to matters larger than the self."

Living purposefully requires self-reflection and self-knowledge.

"We are capable of something unique, each one of us, but it takes time to find out what that is."

In order for individuals to live meaningful lives, they must cultivate the strengths, talents, and capacities that lie within them and use them for the benefit of others.

No matter what occupies our days, when we reframe our tasks as opportunities to help others, our lives and our work feel more significant.

Stories are particularly essential when it comes to defining our identity - understanding who we are and how we got that way.

People who are driven to contribute to society and to future generations, all share a common pattern: they are more likely to tell redemptive stories about their lives, or stories that transition from bad to good.

The meaning we derive from the experience stays with us, often for our entire lives.

"Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally."

We can grow to lead deeper and more meaningful lives through adversity.

"It is not the actual trauma that is causing the change. It is how people interpret what happens, how what they believe about themselves and life and the world get shaken up, not the trauma itself, that forces people to experience growth."

Contemplating death can actually help us, if we have the proper mindset, to lead more meaningful lives and to be at peace when our final moment on earth arrives.

"That love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire."

The salvation of man is through love and in love.

"Being human, always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself - be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself - by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love - the more human he is."
