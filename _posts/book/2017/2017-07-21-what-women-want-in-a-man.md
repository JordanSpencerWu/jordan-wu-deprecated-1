description: To find the right woman in life we must become a better man. We must have a life mission before we can attract any high-quality woman. It's about being the best version of ourselves and to think with a WIN/WIN mindset. Being a man is about being fearless, controlling our emotions and taking ownership of our own life.

title: "What Women Want In A Man"
---

Masculine Chivalry: It is the sense of duty that a man feels deep within himself to become his best so that he can give his best and feel satisfied that he is doing his best. He doesn't NEED to be approved, praised, or rewarded by weakness while helping to rid the world of all that causes pain and suffering.

The main thing that a woman wants from a man is the experience of feeling like a woman. She wants to lose herself in her feminity, and the only way she can feel this feminine experience is when a man acts like a man.

Become secure in your ability to make intelligent decisions in the face of conflict, and become a master at handling your emotions.

No good woman in her RIGHT mind wants to be with a Mr. Nice-Guy.

Turn the art of disappointing people and putting your needs first into a practice. In other words, make a discipline, a ritual, a way of life.

Become comfortable telling people "No", and hearing "No" from others.

If you don't feel secure within yourself, no woman will feel secure with you.

I'm committed to being a successful man, but not at the expense of my health, meaningful relationships, my morals, and the well-being of others.

"I refuse to suffer." I remind myself that as a man I choose not to suffer.

You being fearful is not going to help ANYONE in this world.

"Does this add value to my life?"

Always remember, garbage in, garbage out.

What she's subconsciously trying to figure out is: When the time comes, can this guy meet my deepest sexual needs?

You are a MAN and you have needs, such as sex. She is a woman and she has needs, such as YOUR DESIRE.

"I am in control of my emotions. I am self-confident and self-assured, and I make excellent decisions. I am a fearless man with immense poise and power."

Find your path in life and be determined to stay on that path no matter what.

Woman are attracted to men who illustrate the traits and qualities of leadership. A good woman will choose to follow and trust a man who is consciously following the path of leadership. Her love, respect, and desire for him will continue to grow so long as he can captivate her mind, body, and soul by making her an irreplaceable partner in his own grand adventure.

Always take ownership of the truth that your life is whatever you make of it, past, present, and future.

In order to master your fears, you must master your emotions.

Challenge yourself consciously and consistently every single day of your life. This will build the most important characteristic found in ALL great leaders and highly successful individuals of society. It will build your courage.

You MUST learn how to accept yourself for who you are and for where you are in life beginning today. Even though your mission as a mature man is to constantly evolve and reach your highest potential, if you fail to accept yourself and find contentment in your present stage of development you won't be effective in becoming the best version of yourself.

Cultivate the habit of being grateful for your life just as it is today, and how you'd like it to be in the future. Make it a HABIT to see the positive side of things, and develop an optimistic disposition towards life. Show your gratitude in how you live your life and EXPECT good things to happen to you.

Don't be afraid to get good advice that can help you to improve yourself and your relationships.
