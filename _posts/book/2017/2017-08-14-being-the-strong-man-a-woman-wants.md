title: "Being the STRONG MAN A Woman Wants"
---

If you don't lead, I can't dance.

"A woman wants to admire and look up to her man, but she doesn't want him to look down on her."

She wants to admire and look up to you. She wants you to be strong.

She wants a man who knows what he wants. The irony is, if you're just always trying to please her, you don't really please her at all.

Dr. Benjamin Spock said that if a father "is to have an ideal influence on his children as well as a good relationship with his wife, he must be first of all a father, which means being a leader of and a model for his children."

Being strong isn't easy. It's taking responsibility for what's going on, taking charge and find solutions.

Be careful not to hurt your wife's feelings, but if you're always led by her advice without using your own judgement, life can become hell. She may lead you to do something wrong.

If you're worthy, the woman will be a helper, if you're not worthy, she will be against you.

It's up to you to make things work.

When you believe you're entitled to being treated well, you won't accept anything less. If you wait until things are very bad, it means you're set the limit too low.

Stop blaming others. Take full responsibility for changing the situation. The only person's behavior you can change is your own. Realize that she responds to what you do or don't do.

When she oppose you, she may be testing to see if you're strong and know what you want. It's an opportunity to push yourself to grow as a person. The bigger the challenge, the more you're pushed to grow.

Being manly means having high moral standards, being self-disciplined, being decisive, having strength in your convictions, being honest and having the courage to face difficulties. It's being confident and self-reliant.

"Love and giving come together." People develop feeling of love for those to whom they give. Problems often begin when people go from being givers to being takers.

Think about what you want to accomplish and plan how you're going to get there. Talk about each other's goals. They give purpose that can keep a couple together in hard times.

People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. When you take an interest in someone's life, that person feels you care and is often more willing to listen to your guidance.

Think before you do anything. Don't just react and follow your emotions. Anticipate situations and plan how to handle them calmly.

Getting angry damages you and other people. It shows you don't know how to handle the situation.

If you avoid making decisions - by letting other decide or by delaying until the decision makes itself - she may feel you're avoiding your responsibilities. Being strong means stepping forward to make decisions in difficult situations and taking responsibility for the outcome.

Watch men who are strong. Watch how they take charge. Become friends with them.

The person who is truly wealthy is the person who is content with what he has.

'Who is truly rich? A man married to a wife whose ways are pleasant, who doesn't demand a lot of material things and who along with her husband appreciates what they have.'

Even if a man has a lot of money and his wife has many servants, she should not be idle, without work.
