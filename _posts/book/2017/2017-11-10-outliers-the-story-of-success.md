title: "OUTLIERS - The STORY of SUCCESS"
---

Appreciate the idea that the values of the world we inhabit and the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are.

This story line is always the same: our hero is born in modest circumstances and by virtue of his own grit and talent fights his way to greatness.

It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.

Matthew Effect: It is those who are successful, who are most likely to be given the kinds of special opportunities that lead to further success.

We overlook just how large a role society play in determining who makes it and who doesn't.

The ingredients of success at the highest level: passion, talent, and hard work.

The 10,000-hour rule: that the ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything.

What truly distinguishes outliers is not their extraordinary talent but their extraordinary opportunities.

Outliers were given a special opportunity to work really hard and seized it, and who happened to come of age at a time when that extraordinary effort was rewarded by the rest of society.

If intelligence matters only up to a point, then pass that point, other things - things that have nothing to do with intelligence - must start to matter more.

Practical intelligence: knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect.

Outliers from lowest social and economic class lack a community around them that prepared them properly for the world.

Successful people don't do it alone. Where they come from matters.

Success comes from the particular opportunities that our particular place in history presents us with.

If you work hard enough and assert yourself, and use your mind and imagination, you can shape the world to your desires.

Success is not a random act. It arises out of a predictable and powerful set of circumstances and opportunities.

"Culture of honor" means a world where a man's reputation is at the center of his livelihood and self-worth.

Each of us has his or her own distinct personality. But overlaid on top of that are tendencies and assumptions and reflexes handed down to us by the history of the community we grew up in, and those differences are extraordinary specific.

Working really hard is what successful people do.

Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.
