This book does a great job on describing how binary can be used to represent information by using only two states! Many of the chapters reminds of the concepts I had learned while in college, it's hard believe that all information can be represented as 1's and 0's. The discovery of the bit allows us to have the technologies we are using today, it's like a universal language that can be used in many applications. Along with the help of physic we can use binary to do amazing things! Just remember that the technologies we use everyday are possible because of the many years of research from great minds.

If you want to understand how binary works and how it is used in software and computer hardware, I recommend reading this book.
