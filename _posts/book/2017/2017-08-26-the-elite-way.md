Real confidence comes from within.

A quitter is a person who gives up too easily because of a lack of confidence.

A hater is a person who gives up too easily and who tries to project their lack of confidence and self-doubt onto others.

A major facet of gaining real confidence is trusting yourself.

Real confidence is based on knowledge.

The characteristic of a person with real confidence involves them deflecting attention away from themselves and putting the spotlight on others.

Your game muscle is your mouth piece and your mouthpiece is your conversation.

"When dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic, but creatures of emotions."

Respect is the foundation for every successful relationship.
