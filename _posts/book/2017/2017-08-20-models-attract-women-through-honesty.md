The game is emotions, emotions through movement.

A man's attractiveness is inversely proportional to how needy he is.

The high-status man displays non-neediness.

When you are attracted to a woman, you should be affected by her - you should be invested in her.

Female sexual attraction is based largely in feeling comfortable and secure with a man she meets.

Seduction is the process by which a man induces a woman to become as invested in him as he is in her.

Overcoming your neediness comes through a change in your mindset, your self-perception, and your self-respect.

What woman want you to be: a man who wants to be who he wants to be.

Women are attracted to a man they can respect, to a man they can trust.

The only real dating advice is self-improvement. Love yourself.

The key to non-neediness is to have both: respect for both oneself and for women.

Vulnerability is the path of true human connection and becoming a truly attractive person.

What woman want - what we all really want - is a strong, independent, non-needy partner who fulfills us, who we can share ourselves with and receive them in return.

Remember: what you actually say doesn't matter, why you say it matters.

True honesty is only possible when it is unconditional. The truth is only the truth when it is given as a gift - when nothing is expected in return.

A man who feels like he needs to buy or steal a woman's attention or affection through entertainment, money, or superficiality is a man who is not confident in his identity and who is not genuinely attractive.

A non-needy man does not seek to impose himself on the boundaries of others, he's merely interested in maintaining his own boundaries while respecting the boundaries of others.

There are two main reasons that prevent attracted women from being with you, and they are both quite common. Friction is when a woman finds you to be an attractive man, but there are value differences or external circumstance that prevent her from acting on that attraction or being interested in you. Projection are when women who, for whatever reason, are afraid of their own sexuality and/or openly sexual men.

YOUR values determine your behavior, not what you think she wants, not what you think other want, but what is best for you and best for the relationship.

Male attractiveness is based on how non-needy one is and how comfortable one is in expressing one's desire and vulnerability.

Rejection exists for a reason - it's a means to keep people apart who are not good for each other.

Women who are Unreceptive are just that: they're unavailable and/or uninterested in having a sexual/romantic relationship with you.

Women who are Receptive are woman who are sexually/romantically attracted to you.

You cannot be an attractive and life-changing presence to some women without being a joke or an embarrassment to others.

Success = Maximizing happiness with whichever woman/women we prefer.

There are three ways in which we are honest. 1) living based on our value (lifestyle); 2) becoming comfortable with our intentions (boldness); and 3) by expressing our sexuality freely (communication).

The Three Fundamentals are:

1. Creating an attractive and enriching lifestyle.
2. Overcoming your fears and anxiety around socializing, intimacy and sexuality.
3. Mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.

Overcoming your fear and anxiety will correlate with your overall results with women.

If you play to your strengths - i.e., if you focus your time and energy on meeting women in situations where they are likely to share your values, interests, and needs - then you're going to not only experience a much higher degree of success, but you're going to meet women you enjoy a lot more.

Whether you realize it or not, the results you get with women are always your fault.

Women are attracted to your identity.

Two biggest factors on your appearance are Fashion and Fitness.

Rules to dressing well:

1. Wear clothes that fit.
2. Wear clothes that match.
3. Dress to your personality.

The only important "skill" in dating is learning how to stop buying into your own bullshit, to stop believing your own stories.

She looking for: the man who can make her feel more alive.

The proper way to handle your fear and your anxiety is to accept it, recognize that it's normal and a part of who you are, and to not event try to hide it from the woman you're meeting.

Non-neediness means to feel the fear and not let it define you.

The way to attack anxieties is through incremental, consistent exposure.

Greater boldness leads to greater polarization.

There's no such thing as a man who is adored by women who isn't also creepy some of the time.

Creepiness is behaving in a way that makes a woman feel insecure sexually.

Flirting is expressing your sexuality to a woman in a way that makes her feel secure expressing her sexually back towards you.

Blueprint of seduction: a strong, high status, attractive exterior (lifestyle and looks), fearless, and able to open up and shares your vulnerable side with her.

The most important rule of emotional connection is to relate to feeling, not facts.

The exact words you say are far less important than your intentions and level of anxiety.

Cold reading is a skill where you're able to intuitively "know" something about someone else without actually knowing it.

When you are talking to a woman there are only two real subjects of conversation: her and you. Everything you speak about should be, in some way, revealing your identity to her or her identity to you.

Making a connecting requires three steps:

1. being open about yourself
2. getting her to be open about herself
3. relating to each other's experience

Using texting to organize a date.

Getting physical with women, and getting physical quickly and comfortably, is ultimately the difference between having a lot of female friends, and having a lot of girlfriends and dates.

In the courtship process, it's always the man's responsibility to take action and make the moves, and the woman's responsibility to give him signals, telling him when to proceed and when to stop.

If you think you can kiss her, you probably could have ten minutes ago.
