title: "Essentialism - The Disciplined Pursuit of Less"
---

The basic value proposition of Essentialism: only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.

<b>Less but better</b>: The way of the Essentialist is the relentless pursuit of less but better in a disciplined way. This involves learning to tell the difference, learning to filter through all those options and selecting only those that are truly essential. It's not about how to get more things done; it's about how to get the right things done. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential.

Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless.

The pursuit of success can be a catalyst for failure, in other words, success can distract us from focusing on the essential things that produce success in the first place.

<b>Decision fatigue:</b> the more choices we are forced to make, the more the quality of our decision deteriorates.

We live in a world almost everything is worthless and a very few things are exceptionally valuable.

As painful as they can sometime be, trade-offs represent a significant opportunity. By forcing us to weigh both options and strategically select the best one for us, we significantly increase our chance of achieving the outcome we want.

The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is ourselves.

Essential intent applies to so much than your job description or your company's mission statement; a true essential intent is one that guides your greater senese of purpose, and helps you chart your life's path.

The life of an Essentialist is a life of meaning. It is a life that really matters.

Once you become an Essentialist, you will find that you aren't like everybody else. When other people are saying yes, you will find yourself saying no. When other people are doing, you will find yourself thinking. When other people are speaking, you will find yourself listening. When other people are in the spotlight, vying for attention, you will find yourself waiting on the sidelines until it is time to shine. While other people are padding their resumes and building out their LinkedIn profiles, you will be building a career of meaning. While other people are complaining (read: bragging) about how busy they are, you will just be smiling sympathetically, unable to relate. While other people are living a life of stress and chaos, you will be living a life of impact and fulfillment. In many ways, to live as an Essentialist in our too many things all the time society is an act of quiet revolution.
