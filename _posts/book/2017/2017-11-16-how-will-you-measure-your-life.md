Their personal relationship had begun to deteriorate, even as their professional prospects blossomed.

This is why theory can be so valuable: it can explain what will happen, even before you experience it.

Good theory help people steer to good decision - not just in business, but in life, too.

The only way a strategy can get implemented is if we dedicate resources to it.

The trap many people fall into is to allocate their time to whoever screams loudest, and their talent to whatever offers them the fastest reward.

Incentive theory: is that people work in accordance with how you pay them.

Motivation theory: true motivation is getting people to do something because they want to do it.

Find a job that you love and you'll never work a day in your life.

Anticipated opportunities - the opportunities that you can see and choose to pursue.

Unanticipated - usually a cocktail of problems and opportunities that emerges while you are trying to implement the deliberate plan or strategy that you have decided upon.

"To understand a company's strategy, look at what they actually do rather than what they say they will do."

Theory of good money and bad money: When the winning strategy is not yet clear in the initial stages of a new business, good money from investors needs to be patient for growth but impatient for profit. But once a viable strategy has been found, investors need to change what they seek - they should become impatient for growth and patient for profit.

"The job to be done": what causes us to buy a product or service is that we actually hire products to do the jobs for us.

The path to happiness is about finding someone who you want to make happy, someone whose happiness is worth devoting yourself to.

The factors that determine what a company can and cannot do - it capabilities, are resources, processes, and priorities.

The point is that even if you're doing it with the best of intentions, if you find yourself heading down a path of outsourcing more and more of your role as a parent, you will lose more and more of the precious opportunities to help your kids develop their values - which may be the most important capability of all.

Children will learn when they're ready to learn, not when you're ready to teach them; if you are not with them as they encounter challenges in their lives, then you are missing important opportunities to shape their priorities - and their lives.

The skills that leaders have - or lack - depends heavily on which "courses," they have and have not taken along the way.

Their priorities need to be set correctly so they will know how to evaluate their options and make a good choice.

Culture is a way of working together toward common goals that have been followed so frequently and so successfully that people don't even think about trying to do things another way.

A culture is the unique combination of processes and priorities within an organization.

The only way to avoid the consequences of uncomfortable moral concessions in your life is to never start making them in the first place.

The type of person you want to become - what the purpose of your life is - is too important to leave to chance.

The opportunities and challenges in your life that allow you to become that person will, by their way very nature, be emergent.
