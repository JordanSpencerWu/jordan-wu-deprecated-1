Mindfulness is about observation without criticism; being compassionate with yourself.

When you start to feel a little sad, anxious or irritable, it's not the mood that does the damage but how you react to it.

The effort of trying to free yourself from a bad mood or out of unhappiness - of working out why you're unhappy and what you can do about it - often makes things worse.

It's ok to stop treating sadness and other difficulties as problems that need to be solved.

Emotions are "bundles" of thoughts, raw feelings, bodily sensations and impulses. This is what emotions are; they're like a background color that's created when your mind fuses together all of your thoughts, feelings, impulses and bodily sensations to conjure up an overall guiding theme or state of mind.

The evidence is clear; brooding is the problem, not the solution.

Changing your perspective can transform your experience of life, but if you rely solely on outside circumstances changing in order to feel happy and energized, you'll have to wait a very long time.

Being mode: You can change your internal landscape (the mindscape) irrespective of what's happening around you.

Mindful awareness - or mindfulness - spontaneously arises out of this Being mode when we earn to pay attention, on purpose, in the present moment, without judgement, to things as they actually are.

The very foundation of mindful awareness: waking up to what's happening inside of you, and in the world, moment by moment.

Meaningful work, whether paid or unpaid, is a surefire way of boosting happiness.

Train yourself to notice when your autopilot is taking over, so that you can then make a choice about what you want your mind to be focusing upon.

Relearn how to bring awareness to everyday activities so that you can see life as it is, unfolding moment by moment.

None of us can control what thoughts rampage through our minds, or the "weather" they can create. But we do have some control over how we relate to it.

We can easily spend so much time "in our head" that we almost forget we have a body at all.

To cultivate mindfulness truly, we need to become fully integrated with our body once more.

Happiness is looking at the same things with different eyes.

The spirit in which you do something is often as important as the act itself.

If you do things in an open-hearted, welcoming manner, you there by activate the mind's "approach" system: your life has a chance to become richer, warmer, more flexible and more creative.

Mindfulness is about reorienting your life, so you can enjoy it to the full.

You don't have to change much of what you do from day to day, but instead learn to do the same things differently; to surround your tasks with the fresh air of awareness and choice.

Our thoughts are like rumors in the mind. They might be true, but then again, they might not be

We are all stumbling through life trying to find happiness and meaning.

Tiny actions can fundamentally alter your relationship to the world for the better.

Everyday life offers endless opportunities for you to stop, to focus, to remind yourself to be fully awake and present to what is happening right now.

Practice as if your life depended on it, as in many ways, it surely does. For then you will be able to live the life you have - and live it as if it truly mattered.
