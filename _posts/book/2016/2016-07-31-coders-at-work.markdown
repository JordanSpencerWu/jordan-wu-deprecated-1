description: This was an interesting book where the author Peter Seibel interviews top programmers. The book is written like a script where both the author and programmers are having a long conversation about their programming experience. It's interesting to learn how each programmer begin coding and how their views on skills needed to become successful. This book offers a unique glimpse of the past from each programmer's perspective.

This is a interesting book where I the reader felt like I was actually talking to each programmer being interviewed. I enjoyed learning about the past when Computer Science wasn't a academic degree. A time when computers were expensive and a limited amount of people had access to them.

Most if not all of the interviewee started programming at a young age. The languages they learned were low level like BASIC, APL, Fortan, LISP, and Perl to name a few. You had to keep track of memory storage since it was a limiting factor. Thanks to the Moorse's Law, these days we don't have to worry about memory storage!

I remember learning about transistors in college, a device that represents two states. These devices are semiconductors that can be both a conductor or insulator. The combination of transistors will give us logic gates, which allows computer to perform operations. It's amazing how two states can be used to represent information and perform arithmetic operations!

I noticed that most of the interviewee had access to a computer at a young age. Their parents were skilled professionals or worked at a university. They would read about coding in a magazine or book then applied what they learned. Some would take programming courses at a university, the courses were a part of Mathematics and Phyics.

Something interesting I learn from the book is when picking a languages, you are picking a community. All programming languages has a user base. A community where people help each other learn. That's what makes a program language so great, the community!

When debugging a program, there's many tools that can help. The print statement seem to be the best debugging tool. It's simple and easy to use. The other tools are applying break points and running the program step by step, observing the variables in memory and making sure they are correct. 

There was a huge emphasis on coding styles! The code should be readable! Creating clean code will increase productivity and improve maintenance. Think of the code as our house, everyone wants a clean house!

The book mentions ways to recognize talent. I think the best way to recognize talent isn't from doing whiteboard coding interviews. It from how passionate the individual is about programming and learning. Other skills equally important are communication and teamwork!

Peter Seibel asked this question to all the interviewee. __"Do you consider yourself a scientist, an engineer, an artist, or a craftsman?__ The response he got from each programmer varied and was my favorite question.
