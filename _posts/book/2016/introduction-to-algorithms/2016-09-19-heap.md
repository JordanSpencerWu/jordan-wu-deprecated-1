The __(binary) heap__ data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree. An array $A$ that represents a heap is an object with two attributes: $A.length$, which (as usual) gives the number of elements in the array, and $A.heap-size$, which represents how many elements in the heap are stored within array $A$. The root of the tree is $A[1]$, and given the index $i$ of a node, we can easily compute the indices of its parent, left child, and right child:

##### PARENT(i)

$$return \ \lfloor \frac{i}{2} \rfloor$$

##### LEFT(i)

$$return \ 2i$$

##### RIGHT(i)

$$return \ 2i + 1$$

We define the __height of a node__ in a heap to be the number of edges on the longest simple downward path from the node to a leaf, and we define the __height of the heap__ to be the height of its root.

There are two kinds of binary heaps: __max-heaps__ and __min-heaps__

##### Max-heap

The __max-heap property__ is that for every node $i$ other than the root,

$$A[PARENT(i)] \geq A[i]$$

Thus, the largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root $A[1]$ (the first element in the array)

In order to maintain the max-heap property, we call the procedure __MAX-HEAPIFY__. Its input are an array $A$ and an index $i$ into the array. Assuming that the binary trees rooted at $LEFT(i)$ and $RIGHT(i)$ are max-heaps, but that $A[i]$ might be smaller than its children, thus violating the max-heap property. __MAX-HEAPIFY__ lets the value at $A[i]$ "float down" in the max-heap so that the subtree rooted at index $i$ obeys the max-heap property.

##### MAX-HEAPIFY(A,i)

{% highlight java %}
  l = LEFT(i)
  r = RIGHT(i)
  if l <= A.heap-size and A[l] > A[i]
    largest = l
  else largest = i
  if r <= A.heap-size and A[r] > A[largest]
    largest = r
  if largest != i
    exchange A[i] with A[largest]
    MAX-HEAPIFY(A.largest)
{% endhighlight %}

At each step, the largest of the elements $A[i]$, $A[LEFT(i)]$, and $A[RIGHT(i)]$ is determined, and its index is stored in largest. If $A[i]$ is largest, then the subtree rooted at node $i$ is already a max-heap and the procedure terminates. Otherwise, one of the two children has the largest element, and $A[i]$ is swapped with $A[largest]$, which causes node $i$ and its children to satify the max-heap property.

The worst-case running time is $\Theta(lg \\ n)$.

##### Java Implementation

{% highlight java %}
  public class Example {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          int[] unsortedArray = {16, 4, 10, 14, 7, 9, 3, 2, 8, 1};
          maxHeapify(unsortedArray,1);
          printArray(unsortedArray);
          // returns 16 14 10 8 7 9 3 2 4 1
      }

      public static void maxHeapify(int[] array, int parentIndex) {
          int leftChildIndex = (parentIndex * 2) + 1;
          int rightChildIndex = (parentIndex * 2) + 2;
          int indexOfLargestValue = parentIndex;

          if (leftChildIndex < array.length && array[leftChildIndex] > array[indexOfLargestValue]) {
              indexOfLargestValue = leftChildIndex;
          }
          if (rightChildIndex < array.length && array[rightChildIndex] > array[indexOfLargestValue]) {
              indexOfLargestValue = rightChildIndex;
          }
          if (indexOfLargestValue != parentIndex) {
              int temp = array[parentIndex];
              array[parentIndex] = array[indexOfLargestValue];
              array[indexOfLargestValue] = temp;
              maxHeapify(array, indexOfLargestValue);
          }
      }

      public static void printArray(int[] array) {
          for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
              System.out.print(array[i] + " ");
          }
      }
  }
{% endhighlight %}

##### Min-heap

The __min-heap property__ is that for every node $i$ other than the root,

$$A[PARENT(i)] \leq A[i]$$

The smallest element in a min-heap is at the root.

In order to maintain the min-heap property, we call the procedure __MIN-HEAPIFY__. Its input are an array $A$ and an index $i$ into the array. Assuming that the binary trees rooted at $LEFT(i)$ and $RIGHT(i)$ are min-heaps, but that $A[i]$ might be greater than its children, thus violating the min-heap property. __MIN-HEAPIFY__ lets the value at $A[i]$ "float down" in the min-heap so that the subtree rooted at index $i$ obeys the min-heap property.

##### MIN-HEAPIFY(A,i)

{% highlight java %}
  l = LEFT(i)
  r = RIGHT(i)
  if l <= A.heap-size and A[l] < A[i]
    lowest = l
  else lowest = i
  if r <= A.heap-size and A[r] < A[lowest]
    lowest = r
  if lowest != i
    exchange A[i] with A[lowest]
    MAX-HEAPIFY(A.lowest)
{% endhighlight %}

At each step, the lowest of the elements $A[i]$, $A[LEFT(i)]$, and $A[RIGHT(i)]$ is determined, and its index is stored in lowest. If $A[i]$ is lowest, then the subtree rooted at node $i$ is already a max-heap and the procedure terminates. Otherwise, one of the two children has the lowest element, and $A[i]$ is swapped with $A[lowest]$, which causes node $i$ and its children to satify the min-heap property.

The worst-case running time is $\Theta(lg \\ n)$.

            printArray(unsortedArray);
            // returns 4 7 10 14 1 9 3 2 8 16
        }
