> A wise man learns by the mistakes of others, a fool only by his own.

> Always make sure you update, compile, and test the code before committing.

> This is the golden rule of programming, the straight brick road to perfection: whenever a mistake happens, ask yourself how to avoid that mistake in the future.

> Function calls require thinking. Read the documentation. Double-check to make sure you know what the function is doing.

> Debugging code is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as complexly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

> All errors will be within 3 lines of the place you last changed the program.

> Test every line of code. Write a small test, then write the code.

> Every time you change a line of code, double check everywhere related to that line.

> If your code is not _perfectly_ beautiful when you write it, don't despair. It never will be. Satisfy yourself when it's good enough, and do better next time.

> It doesn't matter how good you are at programming. Your code can be improved when people look at it.

> Many people make a mistake: they try to optimize without collecting data.

> Always attack your own ideas the hardest.

> When someone points out a mistake, it's a chance to grow. People who are honest with you and point out your mistakes are in some ways true friends.

> Good applications are discoverable, meaning they can be used without reading a manual. Good code is discoverable, meaning things are easy to find. When you create a feature, ask yourself, "How will the user discover this feature?"

> If code is discoverable, users will seek greater knowledge of the system. If code is not discoverable, users will copy and paste from examples.

> Ken Thompson: "Good code, there's one place where you add that feature and it fits; fragile code, you've got to touch ten places."

> Writing code before it needs to be written is poor management. Never do today what can be put off to tomorrow. You may not have to do it.

> If something will be easier to do now than later, do it now.

> Fixing mistakes, instead of starting over from scratch, is the way to learn. The first step to perfection is learning how to recover when you aren't perfect.
