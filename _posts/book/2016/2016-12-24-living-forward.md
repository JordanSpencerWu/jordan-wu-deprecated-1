description: The book is about creating a plan to live the life you want. The metaphor the book uses is that life is like a GPS, we need to know the end destination before we know how to get where we are to the destination we want to go. This involves creating a Life Plan, a written document that contains specific actions to get to our destination in life.

A Life Plan is the application you need to stay on the path to the life you desire. Without one, chances are you'll end up at an unintended destination due to drafting. "The drift", a metaphor for understanding how we arrive at destinations we don't consciously choose. Life Planning is the exact opposite of the drift, it's about proactivity and taking responsibility. The earlier you get started, the most influence you can have on getting the life you want - financially, relationally, physically, and spiritually.

<blockquote>
  A Life Plan is a short-written document, usually eight to fifteen pages long. It is created by you and for you. It describes how you want to be remembered. It articulates your personal priorities. It provides the specific actions necessary to take you from where you are to where you want to be in every major area of your life. It is most of all a living document that you will tweak and adjust as necessary for the rest of your life.
</blockquote>

You can't always choose what happens to you. Accidents and tragedies happen. What you can do is choose how your respond to those situations. One of the best ways to begin is to ask yourself the right questions.

##### Three Powerful Questions

1. How do I want to be remembered?
2. What matter most?
3. How can I get from here to where I want to be?

Some of the benefits of a Life Plan are <b>Clarifying Priorities</b>, enabling you to set your priorities and understand how they work together and when they don't. <b>Maintaining Balance</b> by giving appropriate attention to each of the various categories of your life. <b>Filtering Opportunities</b>, reprioritize and reorganize life which gives courage to manage opportunities rather than being managed by them. <b>Facing Reality</b>, the truth is, you can't improve what you won't face and own. <b>Envisioning the Future</b>, you need to acknowledge where you are, but you also need to see clearly where you are going. Lastly <b>Avoiding Regret</b>, while you can't control everything, you can control more than you think, and you can live your life with a plan that will dramatically improve your chances of ending up at a destination you choose.

As we think about our legacy, we need to start with the end. Our days add up to a lifetime. At the end of that life, what will those closest to you say, what will they remember, how will they assess your legacy? Truth is, everyone is in the process of creating and leaving a legacy. Our legacy comprises the spiritual, intellectual, relational, vocational, and social capital we pass on.
You start by writing your Eulogy, first by identifying your key relationships. Describe how you want to be remembered by each group of relationships. Be sure to make your legacy statement as compelling as you can.

Life Accounts, your life is an interrelated collection of interests, responsibilities, dreams, and activities. This is divided into three circles - Circle of Being (solely on you in relation to yourself), Circle of Relating (collection of activities centered on you in relation to others), and Circle of Doing (collection of activities dealing with you in relation to your output). Write out your Life Accounts and remember that they are unique to you and are interrelated. Once you have your list of Life Accounts, determine the condition of each Life Account. They can be growing balance (more than you need), consistent balance (have what you need), or declining balance (less than you need). Your Life is a collection of accounts and each of them requires the right attentions.

Remember we have to attend to ourselves first in order to be spiritually, emotionally, intellectually, and physically available to others.

##### Break each Life Account down into five sections

1. Purpose Statement
2. Envisioned Future
3. Inspiring Quote
4. Current Reality
5. Specific Commitments

Each section should be a series of bullets that are Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, and Time-bound (SMART).

##### The day of creating your Life Plan (spend the whole day working on it)

1. Check Your Attitude
2. Remind Yourself of the Goal
3. Trust the Process
4. Listen to Your Heart
5. Stay Focused

You need to review, tweak, and revisit it regularly if it is to actually shape your life. Reviewing your Life Plan will help expand your working memory and thereby increase the chances you'll achieve your goals. Start by reading your Plan out loud daily for the first ninety days. Then review your Plan weekly while tweaking it Quarterly. Always revise your Plan yearly!
