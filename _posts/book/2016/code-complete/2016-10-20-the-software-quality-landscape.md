Software has both external and internal quality characteristics. External characteristics of quality are the only kind of software characteristics that user care about. Programmers care about both external and internal quality characteristics.

Software quality assurance is a planned and systematic program of activities designed to ensure that a system has the desired characteristics. Development efforts that include quality-assurance activities produce better software than those that do not.

> A single architectural error can affect several classes and dozens of routines, whereas a single construction error is unlikely to affect more than one routine or class.

The General Principle of Software Quality is that improving quality reduces development costs. The best way to improve productivity and quality is to reduce the time spent reworking code, whether the rework arises from changes in requirements, changes in design, or debugging.
