Debugging is the process of identifying the root cause of an error and correcting it. A bug in software means that a programmer made a mistake. You don't need to learn how to fix defects; you need to learn how to avoid them in the first place. If you have a problem with a program you've written, it's your fault.

An error that doesn't occur predictably is usually an initialization error, a timing issue, or a dangling-pointer problem.

Brute force approach to debugging is a technique that might be tedious, arduous, and time consuming but that is guaranteed to solve the problem.

The importance of good programming practices: good formatting, commenting, variable names, routine names, and other elements of programming style help structure the programming background so that likely defects appear as variations and stand out.

The programmers who debug most effectively mentally slice away parts of the program that aren't relevant during debugging.
