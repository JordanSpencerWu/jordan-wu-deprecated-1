All control structures depend on the evaluation of boolean expression. Use the identifiers true and false in boolean expressions rather than using values like 0 and 1. Avoid complicated negative boolean expressions in your program. Organize numeric test so that they follow points on a number line.

> A "compound statement" or "block" is a collection of statements that are treated as a single statement for purpose of controlling the flow of a program.

> Avoid deep nesting, few people can understand more than three levels of nested _ifs_.

The core of structured programming is the simple idea that a program should use only one-in, one-out control constructs. A one-in, one-out control construct is a block of code that has only one place it can start and only one place it can end. A structured program progresses in an orderly, disciplined way, rather than jumping around unpredictably.

The central concept of structured programming are still useful today and apply to consideration in using _break_, _continue_, _throw_, _catch_, _return_, and other topics.

> "Programming complexity" is the number of mental objects you have to keep in mind simultaneously in order to understand the program.
