Pseudocode Programming Process (PPP), which reduces the work required during design and documentation and improves the quality of both. The term "pseudocode" refers to an informal, English-like notation for describing how an algorithm, a routine, a class, or a program will work. The PPP defines a specific approach to using pseudocode to streamline the creation of code within routines.

The process involves designing the class or routine using pseudocode. After you write the code using the pseudocode as a guideline. Once this is completed, you would check and test the correctness of the code. Repeat a step if necessary. Other approaches are test-first development, refactoring, and design by contract.
