title: "Metaphors for a Richer Understanding of Software Development"
---

Modeling is the use of metaphor, by comparing a topic you understand poorly to something similar you understand better, this provides better insights that results in better understanding of a less-familiar topic. Metaphors is a powerful technique that can be used in software development, here is an example from The Pragmatic Programmer.

> Don't Live with Broken Windows

In cities there are some buildings that are beautiful and clean, while others are rotting hulk. Research shows that the main trigger mechanism that turns a clean building into a smashed and abandoned derelict, is a broken window.

One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandoned - a sense that the owner don't care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural damage begins. 

The simple solution to this problem is to fix the broken window as soon as possible so that _entropy_ (disorder) doesn't spread.

This applies to programming called software rot, create clean code so that your software doesn't rot. Bad code will decrease productivity and you won't meet the project deadlines.
