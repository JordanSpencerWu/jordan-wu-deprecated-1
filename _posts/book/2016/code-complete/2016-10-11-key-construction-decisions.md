title: "Key Construction Decisions"
---

Once we have all the preparation activities done, we can start making construction decisions. The choice of programming language in which the system will be implemented is a key decision. Studies have shown that the programming-language choice affects productivity and code quality. Programmers working with high-level languages achieve better productivity and quality than those working with lower-level languages. Programmers who program "into" a language first decide what thoughts they want to express, and then they determine how to express those thoughts using the tools provided by their specific language. If your language lacks constructs that you want to use or is prone to other kinds of problems, try to compensate for them. Invent your own coding conventions, standards, class libraries, and other augmentations.
