A routine is an individual method or procedure invocable for a single purpose. The routine is the greatest technique ever invented for saving space and improving performance. The single most important reason to create a routine is to reduce a program's complexity. One of the strongest mental blocks to creating routines is a reluctance to create a simple routine for a simple purpose.

Cohesion for routines refers to how closely the operation in a routine are related. The goal is to have each routine do one thing well and not do anything else. A good name for a routine clearly describles everything the routine does. A function is a routine that returns a value; a procedure is a routine that does not.
