Testing is usually broken into two broad categories: black-box testing and white-box (or glass-box) testing. "Black-box testing" refers to tests in which the tester cannot see the inner working of the item being tested. "White-box testing" refers to tests which the tester is aware of the inner working of the item being tested.

> Testing is a means of detecting errors.

> Debugging is a means of diagnosing and correcting the root causes of errors that have already been detected.

Writing test cases first will minimize the amount of time between when a defect is inserted into the code and when the defect is detected and removed. Test-first programming is one of the most beneficial software practices.

"Code coverage" testing or "logic coverage" testing are approaches in which you test all the path through a program.

The idea of boundary analysis is to write test cases that exercise the boundary conditions, also applies to minimum and maximum allowable values.
