Software construction is similar to construction of house, school, or a skyscraper. There are many complicated processes like problem definition, requirement development, software architecture, detailed design, coding and debugging, unit testing, etc. Construction refers to the process of building, in this case it's mostly coding and debugging along with other activities. The ideal software project goes through careful requirements development and architectural design before construction (can also be refer as coding or programming) begins.
