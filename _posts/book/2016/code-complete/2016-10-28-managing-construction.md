Quality goals and size of the project both significantly affect how a specific software project should be managed.

If someone on a project is going to define standards, have a respected architect define the standard rather than the manager.

Configuration management is the practice of identifying project artifacts and handling changes systematically so that a system can maintain its integrity over time. It includes technique for evaluating proposed changes, tracking changes, and keeping copies of the system as it existed at various point in time. Usually called "software configuration management" (SCM), focuses on a program's requirements, source code, documentation, and test data.

Standardized development machine configurations is a disk image created of a standard developer workstation, including all the common developer tools, office applications, and so on.

A backup plan; it's the idea of backing up your work periodically. Save a copy of everything: source code, compilers, tools, requirements, design, documentation, everything you need to re-create the product.

Managing a software project is one of the formidable challenges of the twenty-first century, and estimating the size of a project and effort required to complete it is one of the most challenging aspects of software-project management.	
Another level of sophistication is required to develop a group of programs that work together. Such group is called a software "system".
