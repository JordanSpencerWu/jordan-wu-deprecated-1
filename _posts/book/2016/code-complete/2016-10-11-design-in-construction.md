The phrase "software design" means the conception, invention, or contrivance of a scheme for turning a specification for computer software into operational software. Design is the activity that links requirements to coding and debugging.

A "wicked" problem as onethat could be clearly defined only by solving it, or by solving part of it. This paradox implies that you have to "solve" the problem once in order to clearly define it and then solve it again to create a solution that works.

Good design depends on understanding the importance of managing complexity by dividing the system into subsystems. The more independent the subsystem are, the more you make it safe to focus on one bit of complexity at a time. There's a list of desirable characteristics of a Design: Minimal complexity, Ease of maintenance, Loose coupling, Extensibility, Reusability, High fan-in, Low-to-medium fan-out, portability, Leanness, and Stratification.
