The worlds has changed at a rapid rate after the invention of transistors, a device that can hold one of two states. This technology has brought many changes to industries over the years. One of the biggest trends involves the web, many advancements has made the web a place for business. Investing in a website will drastically increase the value of any company, this is the best medium where customers purchase products and services. The book talks about creating better user experience (UX) by focusing on usability.

UX is about creating better experience for the users. The average web users are all unique, you can't make any assumptions. Business these days are heavily reliant on interaction over the web where the users are the customers. To keep the customers happy we must focus on usability, how easy it is for users to use your website without question marks. To accomplish this task we can use usability testing that focus on a set of attributes.

##### Usability Attributes

> __Useful__: Does it do something people need done?

> __Learnable__: Can people figure out how to use it?

> __Memorable__: Do they have to relearn it each time they use it?

> __Effective__: Does it get the job done?

> __Efficient__: Does it do it with a reasonable amount of time and effort?

> __Desirable__: Do people want it?

> __Delightful__: Is using it enjoyable, or even fun?

The goal is that a person of average ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it's worth. The answer is "Don't make me think!” Users who goes on your website has a task to accomplish within a time constraint, they want to be able to navigate through the site without wondering if they are doing it right. This means we have to create a website that people can "get it" without too much thinking. The most important thing you can do is to understand the basic principle of eliminating question marks.

A way to enhance usability is by doing a __usability testing__, are about watching one person at a time try to use something to do typical tasks so you can detect and fix the things that confuse or frustrate them. If you want to know whether something is easy enough to use, watch some people while they try to use it and note where they run into problems.

> We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.

Some take away from the books are most of the time people glance at each page and click and navigate to things that attracts them. Users scans the page for keywords they are looking for, they are on a mission to do a task and as the web designers and developers our goal is to make it easy. Make the choices mindless, users don't have to think about how to get to a specific page or accomplish a task. There's many things you can do like having a good navbar, obvious names for links/buttons, breadcrumbs, following existing conventions, and reducing noise.
