##### Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Don't criticize, condemn or complain</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      We are all human!! Everyone thinks differently, there's no need to criticize, condemn or 
      complain about others. Remember people only see the world in their point of veiw and in their 
      world they are the good guys. These actions will not makes things better and will make people 
      hate you more!
      <blockquote>
        Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character 
        and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.
      </blockquote>

    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Give honest and sincere appreciation</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      There is only one way to get anybody to do anything and that is by making the other person 
      want to do it. Human biggest urge is the "the desire to be important" and are craving to be 
      appreciated. This desire to be important will make people strive to be great and giving appreciation 
      will make them feel important. Avoid flattery!! Acknowledge others accomplishments and efforts by 
      giving honest, sincere appreciation.

    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Arouse in the other person an eager want</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      Everyone has their own wants and it differs from ours. The only way to influence other people is to talk about 
      what they want and show them how to get it. Remember that everyone thinks about themselves more than anything in 
      the world, we can use that to our advantage. Before you persuade somebody to do something, take a moment and ask 
      yourself: "How can I make this person want to do it?". An increased tendency to think 
      always in terms of other people's point of view, and see things from their angle will make you successful in life. 
      A individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage.
      <blockquote>
        People who can put themselves in the place of other people who can understand the working of their minds, 
        need never worry about what the future has in store for them.

##### Ways to Make People Like You

  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Become genuinely interested in other people</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      Most people can talk about themselves for hours!!! They all want to talk about their unique stories and what they 
      like to do. You can learn a lot from listening to others! Next time you see someone think about all the things you might 
      learn from listening. 
      <blockquote>
        It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life 
        and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures 
        spring.
      </blockquote>

  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-smile-o" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Smile</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      Well this is a no brainer a smile is worth a million dollars!! I am talking about a real smile, a smile 
      that comes from within. There are going to be times in you life where it is hard to smile, but remember 
      smiling brings happiness to you and others around you!!
      <blockquote>
        Every body in the world is seeking happiness - and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling 
        your thoughts. Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.

    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      Everyone is important and the only way to distinguish them from others is by remembering their name. Their name 
      is a unique identifier and it's important to everyone!! Most people don't use the time and energy to remember names, 
      don't be those people!!
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      Being a good listener is always better than being a good talker!! Everyone has their own unique stories and 
      they all want a good listener. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to 
      talk about themselves and their accomplishments.

    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Talk in terms of the other person's interests</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      Everyone has hobbies and interests!! They will be more interested in you if you show curiosity in their 
      hobbies and interests. We are curiosity creatures and having a diversity of knowledge will only make us 
      more interesting to others. Remember talking in terms of the other person's interests pays off for both parties.

    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">

      to others. We are all in this together and helping each other achieve the desire to be important will bring happiness

##### How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking

  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      Everyone wants to be right and will strive to justify that. If correcting someone will make them hate you, why would you 
      want to do that? Never question ones intelligence, judgement, pride and self-respect! Avoid arguments at all cost, there's never 
      a winner and it will only hurt both parties sense of pride. Remember to ask yourself: "What will you gain and lose from winning the 
      argument?".
      <blockquote>
        "Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love," and a misunderstanding is never ended 
        by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person's viewpoint.
      </blockquote>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong."</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      Everyone learns and understand things differently. We make mistakes in life, but we can learn from them. It's important to help 
      people recognize that they might be wrong by reminding them of a common human feature of making mistakes. Never tell someone they are 
      wrong, instead work together to find the right. By working together you can see their point of view and understand why they might 
      see something differently. Remember there's never a wrong answer!
      <blockquote>
        You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself
      </blockquote>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      Let's be honest with ourselves and know that we aren't always right. Admitting that you were wrong will allow others to understand your point of view and 
      how you thought it was right. It's ok to be wrong, no one is perfect!
      <blockquote>
        Any fool can try and defend his or her mistakes - and most fools do - but it raises one above 
        the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and exualtaion to admit one's mistake.
      </blockquote>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Begin in a friendly way</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      Start by being friendly towards others, this display of friendliness will get others to agree with you. People are more 
      likely to cooperate with you if you work alongside with them. 
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Get the other person saying "yes, yes" immediately</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      The best way to talk to people is not by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing and keep 
      on emphasizing, the things on which you agree. The goal is to get the "yes" response, this helps in understanding each others 
      wants and needs.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Let the other person do a great deal of the talking</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      Let's remember that people like to talk about themselves! When your friends excel us, they feel important; but when 
      we excel them, they might feel inferior and envious. It's best to let them talk about themselves and we can be the 
      good listener.
      <blockquote>
        If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friend excel you.

  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      We have more faith in ideas that we discover for ourself than in the ideas of others. It's best to make suggestions and let 
      the other person think out the conclusion. We want them to agree with us and if we give them suggestions, they 
      can decided whether or not they agree with our idea.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      We only see the world from our own point of view. This view is different in others, instead of viewing the world in 
      one perceptive let's expand our view to others. Try honestly to put youself in his or her place.
      <blockquote>
        Remember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don't think so. Don't condemn them. Any fool can 
        do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that.

    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" style="margin-top: 10px;"></i><p style="margin: 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 0;">Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires</p></div>
    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      Most people you meet in your life want sympathy, give it to them, and they will love you.
      <blockquote>
        'Self-pity' for misfortunes real or imaginary is in some measure, practically a universal practice.

    <div class="collapsible-body" style="padding: 0 10px;">
      There will be times where both parties must compromise on an agreement. When both parties fully understand 
      each others point of view, they will be honest and fair on an agreement.

      get people's attention.
