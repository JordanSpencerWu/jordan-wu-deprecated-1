People speak different love languages.

We must be willing to learn our spouse's primary love language if we are to be effective communicators of love.

"Inside every child is an 'emotional tank' waiting to be filled with love. When a child really feels loved, he will develop normally, but when the love thank is empty, the child will misbehave. Much of the misbehavior of children is motivated by the craving of an empty 'love tank'."

The euphoria of the "in-love" state give us the illusion that we have an intimate relationship.

"Real love" to be genuinely loved by another, to know a love that grows out of reason and choice, not instinct. I need to be loved by someone who chooses to love me, who sees in me something worth loving.

Verbal compliments, or words of appreciation, are powerful communiactors of love.

The latent potential within your spouse in his or her area of insecurity may await your encouraging words.

Encouragement requires empathy and seeing the world from your spouse's perspective.

Mature love - love to which we aspire if we seek a growing marriage.

Forgiveness is the way of love.

Forgiveness is an expression of love. "I love you. I care about you, and I choose to forgive you. Even though my feelings of hurt may linger, I will not allow what has happened to come between us. I hope that we can learn from this experience. You are not a failure because you have failed. You are my spouse, and together we will go on from here."

If we wish to love each other, we need to know what the other person wants.

Possibly the deepest human need is the need to feel apprecitated.

By "quality time," I mean giving someone your undivided attention.

What makes one person feel loved emotionally is not always the thing that makes another person feel loved emotionally.

Quality time means that we are doing something together and that we are going our full attention to the other person.

Quality conversation mean sympathetic dialogue where two individual are sharing their experiences, thoughts, feelings, and desires in a friendly, uninterrupted context.

A relationship calls for sympathetic listening with a view to understanding the other person's thoughts, feelings, and desires.

Physical presence in the time of crisis is the most powerful gift you can give if your spouse's primary love language is receiving gifts.

Act of service mean doing things you know your spouse would like you to do.

"No one likes to be forced to do anything. In fact, love is always freely given. Love cannot be demanded. We can request things of each other, but we must never demand anything. Requests give direction to love, but demands stop the flow of love."

Love is a choice and cannot be coerced.

If your spouse's love language is acts of service, then "action speak louder than words."

Physical touch is a way of communicating emotional love.

Three ways to discover your own primary love language:

1. What does your spouse do or fail to do that hurts you most deeply? The opposite of what hurts you most is probably your love language.
2. What have you most often requested of your spouse? The thing you have most often requested is likely the thing that would make you feel most loved.
3. In what way do you regularly express love to your spouse? Your method of expressing love may be an inclication that would also make you feel loved.

We are creature of choice.

Love doesn't erase the past, but it makes the future different.

Love is something you do for someone else.

Love is a choice.
