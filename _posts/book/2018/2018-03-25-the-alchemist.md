Along the way we will learn from others and our environments. Remember to be present and focused without losing sight of our surrounding.

"To realize one's destiny is a person's only obligation."

It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.

Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.

The world's greatest lie: that at a certain point in our lives, we lost control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate.

Personal Legend is what you have always wanted to accomplish.

There is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something it's because that desire originated in the soul of the universe.

When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.

"Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water, and it is buried by the same currents."

Everything in life has its price.

People fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day.

I'm like everyone else - I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.

If I can learn to understand this language without words, I can learn to understand the world.

"You must always know what it is that you want."

It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired.

Making a decision was only the beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.

People need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.

"We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it's our life or our possessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the story of the world were written by the same hand."

All things are the manifestation of one thing only.

It's only those who are persistent, and willing to study things deeply, who achieve the Master Work.

"Everyone has his or her own way of learning things but, we're both in search of our Personal Legends.

If you can concentrate always on the present, youâ€™ll be a happy man.

Life is the moment we're living right now.

Any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history of all things.

If you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better.

Remember that whatever you hear is, there you will find your treasure. You've got to find the treasure, so that everything you have learned along the way can make sense.

"You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his Personal Legend. If he abandons that because it wasn't true love... the love that speaks the Language of the World."

There is only one way to learn and it's through action.

"God created the world so that through its visible objects, men could understand his spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom."

"Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the Soul of the World, and it will one day return there."

People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that they don't deserve them, or that they'll be unable to achieve them.

"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity."

"We don't want people to suffer because they don't follow their hearts."

Before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we've learned as we've moved toward that dream.

"Your eyes show the strength of your soul."

"If a person is living out his Personal Legend, he knows everything he needs to know. There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.

When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.

Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World.

Because when we love, we always strive to become better than we are.
