title: "WILLPOWER DOESN'T WORK"

There's a technological shift in our environment to produce various addictions primary to technology, but also to stimulants such as caffeine, fast-absorbing foods containing high amounts of carbohydrates and sugar, and work.

If you want to control your life, willpower should not be your strategy of choice.

If you're required to exert willpower to do something, there is an obvious internal conflict.

1. You don't know what you want.
2. Your desire (your why) for your goals isn't strong enough.
3. You aren't invested in yourself and your dreams.
4. Your environment opposes your goal.

A conscious personal evolution involves purposefully controlling and creating environment that shape us into the person we want to become.

Your worldview, belief, and values didn't come from within you, but from outside of you.

The hero is a product of a situation rather than the result being a product of the hero.

Your potential is shaped by what surrounds you.

We are never independent of context.

Choosing and shaping your environment is at the center of what "free will" really means because your choice of environment and external influences will directly reflect in the person you become.

Who you are and what you can do in one environment is very different from who you are and what you can do in another.

You are acting a particular way based on the rules of the situation you are in.

If you want to change your life, you simply change your environment and roles you are playing.

Two key types of "enriched" environment are highly stressful and rest/rejuvenation.

You must first be a certain way, then act from that place, in order to have what you want. Be -> Do -> Have.

you are where you are because of who you are.

Organization is about putting limits on things, in order to properly organize your life, you need to establish upper and lower limits on everything.

The fewer choices you have to make, the more powerful your choices will be.

Surround yourself with people who remind you more of your future than your past.

1. __DON'T BE A SLAVE TO YOUR ENVIRONMENT__
2. __WHEREVER YOU ARE, THAT'S WHERE YOU SHOULD BE__
3. __ACT ON INSTINCT AND INTUITION, NOT IMPULSE AND DEPENDENCE__
4. __YOU NEED DEEP HUMAN CONNECTIONS TO OVERCOME ANY ADDICTION__

When you allow yourself to be unavailable - physically, mentally, and emotionally - you'll live a far more present life.

If you're serious about living to the highest level, you need to plan for the worst and know exactly how you will respond.

Forcing functions are self-imposed situational factors that literally force you to act and achieve what you intend.

Learning new things requires making mistakes, looking and feeling dumb, and having to rework our worldview to see things from a higher vantage point.

Good emotions lead to good outcomes and negative emotions lead to negative outcomes.

If you constantly avoid pain and mask your emotions, you'll never grow.

"Everything you want is on the other side of fear."

Pain, discomfort, shock, boredom, impostor syndrome, awkwardness, fear, being wrong, failing, ignorance, looking stupid: Your avoidance of these feeling is stopping you from a life greater than your wildest imagination.

Rather than "competing" with people at your perceived skill level, compete with those who are where you want to be.

True learning involves a permanent change in how you see and act in the world.

"When performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates."

"We are kept from our goals not by obstacles but by a clear path to a lesser goal."

Life gives to the giver and takes from the takers.

Being an adaptive learner is all about never getting stuck at a certain level in your development.

"When the student is ready the teacher will appear. When the student is truly ready, the teacher will disappear."

You should work in environments that trigger you into the mental state needed to do the various types of work you do.

"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much."

No matter how "successful" or "evolved" you become, it is essential that you don't let it lead to egotism.

You stand on the shoulders of giants. You could not be where you are without the challenges you've faced, the mentors you've had, and the many people who have created the world you live in.

Please don't commit the fundamental attribution error in believing that others could not do or be better than they are.

When you change your environment, you will change. But it must be your choice.
