description: The process of making music can be a daunting task that all music producer goes through when creating a song. In this book you will learn the basic foundation of making electronic music and the arrangement of the buildup, breakdown, and drop. Along with strategies for starting and finishing a song. The main takeaway, is to understand the attributes of sound, harmony, melody, and rhythm, and form when creating or listening to music.

The drums often provide the essential timekeeping elements, while the bass often provides the notes that define and anchor the chord progression.

Consider the attributes of __sound__, __harmony__, __melody__, __rhythm__, and __form__.

The term __mise en place__ comes from the culinary world and refers to the careful preparation that goes into setting the physical (and mental) space prior to the actual work of cooking.

Apply arbitrary constraints before starting to work, this helps to limit your field of options and allows you to move forward.

__Creation Phase__: your goal should be to capture as much material as possible.

__Editing Phase__: your goal is to carefully refine the material that you generated during the creation phase.

__Tempo__ is one of the defining characteristics of genre.

Take the time to build your own default or template project.

__Timeboxing__ simply means setting a fixed amount of time for a particular task.

Your creative time is essential; you should treat it with care and recognize when you're subconsciously trying to avoid it.

The process of creating art is, fundamentally, a process of work.

Important sounds are typically mixed louder than less important ones.

Sounds can be made to seem closer to the listener by making them louder, "brighter" (an increase in high frequency content in comparison to other sounds), and/or "dryer (an increase in the amount of original, unprocessed signal in comparison to the amount of reverb applied to that signal).

We can think of our musical elements themselves as being divided into __foreground__, __middle ground__, and __background__.

We tend to hear things as being in the foreground if they're high, loud, fast, or subject to a rapid rate of change.

__Anticipation__ - Drums fills are a common technique used to create a sense of transition from one section to another.

__Hesitation__ - Drum fill that lasts longer than expected, extending over the formal boundary between the sections and ending after the rest of the musical material has already changed to the new section.

__Transposition__ means shifting an entire pattern of notes up or down by a specific number of semitones.

__Inversion__ is the process of flipping a collection of notes "upside-down" so that the lowest note becomes the first note and vice versa.

__Retrograde/Reverse__ means flipping a collection of notes backwards, so that the last note becomes the first note and vice versa.

__Time Shifting__ - A looped passage of material can be started at an arbitrary position within the passage.

__Pitch Rotation__ is a process where the rhythm of a passage of notes is retained but the pitches from the passage are shifted to the right or left in time.

__Quantization__ is typically used to correct timing errors in manually played MIDI materials.

__Slicing__ is typically to separate rhythmic events (such as drum hits) from audio material such as drum beats or bass lines.

The __tresillo__, or 3+3+2 pattern, is a widely used rhythmic pattern.

__Hi-hats__ keep time, kick drums emphasize the beats, snares/claps are placed on or around the backbeats (beats 2 and 4).

__Polyphony__ - multiple instruments can play at the same time.

__Monophonic__ - no two instruments can play at the same time.

__Ghost notes__ are extremely quiet notes, normally played on the snare drum, that help to fill in the space between the prominent notes in the pattern.

Use __EQ__ to create space for the bass in the kick drum's track, and vice versa.

Use __EQ__ on every other track to remove low end, which makes room for both kick and bass while reducing overall signal level.

Use __sidechain compression__ to automatically reduce the gain of the bass when the kick is sounding.

You can use the spectrum analyzer to find the frequencies that are louder than the average noise level, and then use __EQ__ to either emphasize those frequency (if they happen to be in tune) or attenuate them (if they're out of tune with respect to the harmonic and melodic part).

__Time-stretching__: adjusting the pitch of a sample independently of its tempo (vice versa).

The term __contour__ is used to refer to the shape of a melody over time - whether the note rise to higher pitches, fall to lower ones, remain at the same pitch, or some combination of these.

We use __contour__ to discuss whether a melody moves by adjacent notes (known as __conjunct motion__ or __motion by step__) or by larger intervals (known as __disjunct motion__ or __motion by leap__).

Good melodies have a strong sense of balance between both aspects of contour: rise vs. fall and conjunct motions vs disjunct motion.

If a melody has moved by step for a while, a good choice might be to then proceed by leap in the opposite direction.

Good melodies often have a single peak note.

Assuming a 4/4 meter, the first and third beat are considered "strong" or "on" beats while the second and fourth are considered "weak" or "off" beats. The odd-numbered subdivisions are perceived as stronger than the even-numbered ones.

The smallest recognizable fragment of a melody is called a motive, and melodies are often constructed from just one or two motives.

The combination of two or more intricate, independent, simultaneous melodies in a composition is called __counterpoint__.

__Contrary motion__, as a general guideline, counterpoint works best when the voices mostly move in opposite directions; one voice moves up while the other moves down.

__Hocket__ is a compositional technique in which the notes of a melodic line quickly alternate between two or more different instrument, such that not two instruments are playing at the same time.

"sound-color melody" refers to the distribution of a melody (or even a single pitch) between multiple instruments.

__Scansion__ is the study of a text's inherent rhythm and the marking of each syllable in the text as being either strongly or weakly stressed.

Most music is considered to be in a particular key.

The relationship between the separate voices when moving between chords is known as voice leading.

A lot of house music chord progressions are a technique called __parallel harmony__, which refers to a method of moving from one chord to another in which each note move by the same number of semitones and in the same direction.

The rate at which the chords change in a piece of music is called the __hormonic rhythm__.

The surface rhythm is the rhythm of individual notes and other events.

As a general (but by no means universal) rule, music with a faster surface rhythm tends to have a slower harmonic rhythm, and vice versa.

__Automation__ is perhaps most commonly used to precisely sculpt a mix to ensure that levels will be perfectly balanced at all points of the song.

The __arrangement__ refers to the layout of the parts of your song along a timeline.

Creating successful arrangements requires having a great internal sense of proportion, an understanding of how long each song section needs to be in relation to the others.

__Verse__ or __"A" Section__: A song's verse is generally a recurring section - usually 16 or 32 bars in length - that serves as the main body of the song.

__Chorus__ or __"B" Section__: It acts as a contrast to the material of the verse and usually contains the "hook" of the song - a melodic idea that is intended to stick in the listener's head.

In music with lyrics, the chorus often contains the title of the song.

A general rule, the first chorus in a song occurs after a verse (although there are some songs that begin with a chorus).

The bridge serves as a contrast to both the verse and chorus and typically occurs only once in a song.

__Layering__: the careful addition and subtraction of parts in order to change the density of the underlying texture.

__Buildup__: usually 16 or 32 bars in length, or some multiple of those - in which layers are added, increasing the music's textural density and perceived sense of energy.

The __breakdown__ is a section of lower energy, designed as a contrast to the buildup, and involves either a gradual or sudden reduction in density. Some common breakdown techniques include removing all of the drum elements or, conversely, removing everything except drums.

__Drop__: The drop is the climax and is generally the most texturally dense passage of music in the track.

__Unique events__ - sounds, gestures, or variation that occur only once and are never repeated.

__Single events__ are short samples or sounds that can be strategically placed throughout your arrangement to add a layer of unpredictability.

__Single musical gesture__ are short phrases or one-time alterations to otherwise consistently repeating patterns.

__Single processing gesture__, one-time changes to the effects processing on one more track.
