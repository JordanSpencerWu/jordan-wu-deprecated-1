Choice, ranging from the trivial to the life-altering, in both its presence and its absence, is an inextricable part of our life.

We can measure our lives by the choices we make, the sum total of which has brought us to wherever and whoever we are today.

When we speak of choice, we must evaluate all available options and select the best one, making the mind as vital to choose as the body.

The ability to choose well is arguably the most powerful tool for controlling our environment.

We have the ability to create choice by altering our interpretation of the world.

We wish to see our lives as offering us choice and the potential for control, even in the most dismal of circumstance.

"We tell ourselves stories in order to live."

Choice connects us and allows us to speak to one another about freedom and hope.

We all want and need to be in control of our lives, but how we understand control depends on the stories we are told and the beliefs we come to hold.

Individualist are primarily motivated by their own preferences, needs, rights, and the contracts they have established with others and give priority to their personal goals over the goals of others."

"The only freedom deserving the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, long as we do not attempt to deprive others of their, or impede their efforts to obtain it... Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, then by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest."

Collectivist are primary motivated by the norms of, and duties imposed by, those collectives and are willing to give priority to the goals of these collective over their own personal goals, emphasizing above all else their connectedness to members of these collectives.

If people so choose, they can take control of their own lives and achieve anything.

What you see determines how you interpret the world, which in turn influences what you expect of the world and how you expect the story of your life to unfold.

So, to be oneself is to make the choices that best reflect the self, and these choices - taken cumulatively - are the expression and enactment of personality - and reflect back upon the person who has made them.

To behave in a way not in keeping with the identity that others have grown to recognize and love is to become unknowable to untrustworthy.

Our lifestyle choices often reveal our values, or at least what we'd like people to perceive as our values.

If we learn we're not as great as we thought we were, we can decide to change our behavior so that it aligns more with how we want to be perceived.

Choice requires us to think more deeply about who we are, both within ourselves and in the eyes of others.

"I choose to discover who I am."

If choice is about possibility, then it's also about responsibility.

More is less, more choice leads to less satisfaction or fulfillment or happiness.

There are consequences to keeping our options open.

We must increase our expertise in order to counteract the limits on our cognitive abilities and resources, enabling us to obtain the most benefit from our choices with the least effort.

It's clear that we should concentrate our own expertise on those domains of choice that are most common and/or important to our lives, and those we actively enjoy learning about and choosing from.

"limits the choices you can make and will make. Knowledge is always important where there's a choice."

We're reluctant to give up choice in any situation because we believe it enables us to change and shape our lives for the better; on the other hand, we recognize from experience and perhaps from intuition that some choices, no matter which option we choose and what the outcome, will always diminish our happiness.

We can similarly choose to relinquish our difficult choices to others, which neatly avoids having to decide between the distress or harm that would result from choosing for ourselves and the diminished autonomy that would result from other's restricting our choices without our approval.
